# Keel Containers — Detailed Plan

## Context

This is the execution layer of the agent development platform, living
at `src/keel/containers/` within the keel package. Installed as part
of `pip install tripwire`. See `overarching-plan.md` for how it fits with
`keel.core` (data) and `keel.ui` (visibility).

Core responsibility: launch containerised agents that work autonomously, with strict egress, persisted state, and automated re-engagement when feedback arrives.

---

## Customisability — Project Repo as the Source of Truth

`keel.containers` is a thin runtime. It ships no skills, no templates, no defaults of its own. Everything customisable lives in the project repo:

- **Skills** — `<project>/.claude/skills/`
- **Agent definitions** — `<project>/agents/`
- **Orchestration patterns** — `<project>/orchestration/`
- **Enums** — `<project>/enums/`
- **Templates** (artifacts, issues, comments, sessions) — `<project>/templates/`

The project repo is the single source of truth and the centre of customisability, auditability, and version control. `keel-containers` clones the project repo, mounts what it needs, runs the orchestration pattern the project repo defines, and stays out of the way.

## Feedback Loop Implementation

### The full feedback table

Every type of feedback that can reach a coding agent, how it's delivered, and what the agent does.

### Re-engagement trigger → context mapping

When a re-engagement is triggered, the PM agent or GitHub Action writes a structured context file that the container reads on startup.

```yaml

### GitHub Actions workflows for automated re-engagement

These live in target repos (not the project repo). They detect feedback events and trigger re-engagement.

#### on-ci-failure.yml

```yaml

    types: [completed]

jobs:

          if [[ "$BRANCH" =~ ^(claude|codex|cursor)/([A-Z]+-[0-9]+) ]]; then

          # For now, post to PR as a structured comment
          PR=$(gh pr list --head "${{ github.event.check_suite.head_branch }}" --json number --jq '.[0].number')

```

### PM agent auto-re-engagement rules

The PM agent (whether containerised or running locally) watches for events and decides
whether to re-engage coding agents. These rules map to the `orchestration.auto_launch_on_status`
field in the PM agent definition.

```
Event: CI failure on agent branch
  PM action:
    1. Read CI failure output from GitHub API
    2. Find session for this issue key
    3. Write re-engagement context file
    4. Call: tripwire session re-engage <id> --trigger ci_failure --context-file <path>
    5. Call: keel-containers launch <id>
    6. Update session status: re_engaged

Event: Verifier submits "request-changes" review
  PM action:
    1. Read verifier's review from GitHub API
    2. Read verified.md if created (FAIL result)
    3. Find session for this issue key
    4. Write re-engagement context with failed criteria
    5. Call: tripwire session re-engage <id> --trigger verifier_rejection --context-file <path>
    6. Call: keel-containers launch <id>

Event: Human submits "request-changes" review
  PM action:
    1. Read review comments from GitHub API
    2. Find session for this issue key
    3. Write re-engagement context with review comments
    4. Call: tripwire session re-engage <id> --trigger human_review_changes --context-file <path>
    5. Call: keel-containers launch <id>

Event: Deploy to test fails
  PM action:
    1. Read deploy logs from GitHub Actions
    2. Find all sessions whose PRs were in this deploy
    3. For each: write re-engagement context, re-engage, re-launch

Event: tripwire node check finds stale nodes
  PM action:
    1. Find sessions referencing stale nodes (via graph index)
    2. For active/waiting sessions: write stale_reference context
    3. Re-engage affected coding agents

Event: Session stuck in waiting state > threshold
  PM action:
    1. Alert human (via UI notification or issue comment)
    2. Do NOT auto-re-engage — waiting states that time out likely need human judgment
```

---

## Container Lifecycle with Persistence

### Docker volume strategy

Each session gets a named Docker volume that persists across container restarts:

```
Volume: vol-api-endpoints-core
  /workspace/
  ├── repos/         # NEW: multi-repo (was just `repo/`)
  │   ├── web-app-backend/
  │   └── web-app-infrastructure/
  ├── project/       # project repo clone (unchanged)
  ├── docs/          # read-only — merged from agent + issue + session docs
  ├── artifacts/     # NEW: where the agent writes plan/checklists
  ├── config/        # session config, re-engage context, issue key
  └── .claude/       # skills mounted from project repo .claude/skills/
```

### Multi-repo cloning

Sessions declare an array of repos via `session.repos[*]` (see the Session model in `keel-plan.md`). All repos are equal — there is no primary. Each one is cloned into `/workspace/repos/<repo-name>/`, and each gets the same agent git identity configured. The agent can branch and PR in any of them.

### Document mounting from issues, sessions, and agent definitions

`/workspace/docs/` is the union of three doc lists, deduplicated by path and mounted read-only:

- **Agent-level** — `agent.context.docs` from `<project>/agents/<id>.yaml` (existing)
- **Issue-level** — `Issue.docs` from each issue assigned to the session (NEW, optional)
- **Session-level** — `AgentSession.docs` from the session YAML (NEW, optional)

Each path is relative to the project repo. The container launch code reads the issue + session + agent and unions the three lists before mounting at `/workspace/docs/<path>` read-only.

**First launch:**
```bash
docker volume create vol-api-endpoints-core

# For each repo declared in session.repos[*], the launch code clones into
# /workspace/repos/<repo-name>/ and sets the same agent git identity.
# Each merged doc path from agent + issue + session is bind-mounted read-only
# under /workspace/docs/<path>.

docker run \
  --name agent-api-endpoints-core \
  -v vol-api-endpoints-core:/workspace \
  -v /path/to/project/docs/api-contract.yaml:/workspace/docs/api-contract.yaml:ro \
  -v /path/to/project/docs/auth/jwt-spec.md:/workspace/docs/auth/jwt-spec.md:ro \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN_BACKEND="$GITHUB_TOKEN_BACKEND" \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN_INFRA="$GITHUB_TOKEN_INFRA" \
  -e AGENT_GIT_USERNAME="seido-backend-bot" \
  -e AGENT_GIT_EMAIL="backend-bot@seido.dev" \
  --network agent-net-api-endpoints-core \
  agent-claude-code:latest
```

**Re-engagement (same volume, new container):**
```bash
# Write re-engagement context to volume
docker run --rm -v vol-api-endpoints-core:/workspace alpine \
  sh -c 'cat > /workspace/config/re_engage.yaml << EOF
trigger: ci_failure
timestamp: "2026-03-26T17:15:00"
context:
  failed_checks:
    - name: ruff
      summary: "src/api/auth.py:45 — E302"
EOF'

# Launch new container with same volume — repos already cloned in /workspace/repos/
docker run \
  --name agent-api-endpoints-core-re1 \
  -v vol-api-endpoints-core:/workspace \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN_BACKEND="$GITHUB_TOKEN_BACKEND" \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN_INFRA="$GITHUB_TOKEN_INFRA" \
  -e AGENT_GIT_USERNAME="seido-backend-bot" \
  -e AGENT_GIT_EMAIL="backend-bot@seido.dev" \
  --network agent-net-api-endpoints-core \
  agent-claude-code:latest
```

**Cleanup (session completed):**
```bash
docker volume rm vol-api-endpoints-core  # only after session marked completed
```

---

## Skills — Loaded from the Project Repo

`keel-containers` ships **no skills**. Every skill an agent reads comes from the project repo's `.claude/skills/` directory at container launch time. There is no "packaged default skill" baked into the runtime image.

How skills get into the project repo: the `keel` package ships them as defaults under `templates/skills/`. `tripwire init` copies the entire `templates/skills/` tree into the new project's `.claude/skills/`. After init, the project owns them — they are committed to git, version-controlled, auditable, and freely editable per project. Two projects can have completely different rules for messaging, both fully under their own control.

### `setup_skills()` — workspace.py

Before the agent starts, `keel_containers/core/workspace.py` calls a `setup_skills()` function that copies the required skills from the project repo into the container workspace.

```python
# keel_containers/core/workspace.py
def setup_skills(workspace_dir: Path, project_dir: Path, agent: AgentDefinition):
    """Copy required skills from the project repo into the container workspace."""
    project_skills_dir = project_dir / ".claude" / "skills"
    workspace_skills_dir = workspace_dir / ".claude" / "skills"

    # Default skills that every agent gets, regardless of agent definition
    default_skills = ["agent-messaging"]

    # Skills the agent definition asks for (e.g. "backend-development", "verification")
    agent_skills = agent.context.skills

    for skill_name in default_skills + agent_skills:
        src = project_skills_dir / skill_name
        if not src.exists():
            raise ConfigError(
                f"Skill '{skill_name}' not found at {src}. "
                f"Run 'tripwire init' to install default skills, "
                f"or add it manually to .claude/skills/."
            )
        copy_tree(src, workspace_skills_dir / skill_name)
```

### Default and per-agent skills

- **Default for every agent**: `["agent-messaging"]` — loaded regardless of what the agent definition says, so every container can talk to the human via the MCP messaging server.
- **Per-agent**: whatever is listed in `agent.context.skills` — typical examples are `backend-development`, `frontend-development`, `verification`, `project-manager`.

If a required skill is missing from `<project>/.claude/skills/`, `setup_skills()` raises a `ConfigError` with a hint to run `tripwire init`. The container does not start with missing skills.

---

## Agent Messaging — MCP Server

### MCP server implementation

A tiny MCP server pre-installed in every container image. It proxies tool calls to the UI backend via HTTP.

```python
# mcp_server/agent_messaging.py (~80 lines)
"""MCP server that exposes send_message and check_messages tools."""

import os
import json
import urllib.request
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.types import Tool, TextContent

AGENT_MSG_URL = os.environ.get("AGENT_MSG_URL", "http://host.docker.internal:8000/api/messages")
SESSION_ID = os.environ["AGENT_SESSION_ID"]

server = Server("agent-messaging")

@server.list_tools()
async def list_tools():
    return [
        Tool(
            name="send_message",
            description="Send a message to the human operator via the project dashboard. Use 'blocking' priority when you need a response before continuing (you should stop working after sending). Use 'informational' for progress updates (keep working).",

        return [TextContent(type="text", text="\n---\n".join(formatted))]
```

### Status messages — structured body

Unlike other message types where `body` is free Markdown, `status` has a structured body with two fields: `state` and `summary`.

```json
{
  "type": "status",
  "priority": "informational",
  "body": {
    "state": "implementing",
    "summary": "Wired the JWT middleware into the auth router. Now writing unit tests for the validation logic."
  }
}
```

- **`state`** — drawn from the `AgentState` enum. The enum is defined in `keel` and is customisable per project via `<project>/enums/agent_state.yaml`. Default states: `investigating`, `planning`, `awaiting_plan_approval`, `implementing`, `testing`, `debugging`, `refactoring`, `documenting`, `self_verifying`, `blocked`, `handed_off`, `done`.
- **`summary`** — 1-2 sentences, plain text. Captures what just happened and what's next.
- **Priority** — always `informational`. A status message never blocks the agent — it sends and keeps working.

**Convention**: agents send a status message every 5 minutes of active work, plus on every state transition (e.g. moving from `planning` to `implementing`). The orchestrator updates `session.current_state` from the latest status message, and the UI displays the current state as a badge on the session card.

### Container configuration for MCP

In Claude Code containers, the MCP server is registered in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-messaging": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/usr/local/lib/mcp_server/agent_messaging.py"],
      "env": {
        "AGENT_MSG_URL": "http://host.docker.internal:8000/api/messages",
        "AGENT_SESSION_ID": "${AGENT_SESSION_ID}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For LangGraph/custom agents, call the HTTP endpoint directly:

```python
import httpx

def send_message(msg_type: str, priority: str, body: str):
    httpx.post(
        f"{os.environ['AGENT_MSG_URL']}",
        json={"session_id": os.environ["AGENT_SESSION_ID"],
              "type": msg_type, "priority": priority, "body": body},
    )
```

### Fallback shell script

For agents that don't use MCP or Python:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /usr/local/bin/agent-msg
# Usage: agent-msg <type> <priority> <body>
curl -s -X POST "${AGENT_MSG_URL:-http://host.docker.internal:8000/api/messages}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"session_id\": \"${AGENT_SESSION_ID}\", \"type\": \"$1\", \"priority\": \"$2\", \"body\": \"$3\"}"
```

### Skill communication protocol

The coding agent and PM agent skills should include instructions on when to use messaging:

```markdown
## Communication with Human Operator

You have a `send_message` MCP tool to communicate with the human operator.

### Mandatory: Plan approval before implementation
Before writing any code, create your implementation plan and send it for approval:
  - Use send_message with type="plan_approval", priority="blocking"
  - Include your full plan as the body (Markdown formatted)
  - STOP after sending — do not write code until approved
  - You will be re-engaged with the approval or feedback

### When to send blocking messages (you must stop after sending):
- You have a question that blocks correct implementation
- You're stuck after trying 3+ approaches
- You need permissions or scope change
- You're handing over to a human

### When to send informational messages (keep working):
- You've reached a milestone (e.g., "tests written, implementing now")
- You found something interesting outside your scope
- Completion notification

### Reading responses
After re-engagement, use the `check_messages` tool to read any responses
from the human before continuing work.
```

### Network egress for messaging

`host.docker.internal:8000` must be allowed in the container network configuration.
This is not external internet — it's the host machine. Add to every agent's implicit
egress whitelist (not user-configurable, always allowed):

```python
# In core/network.py
IMPLICIT_EGRESS = [
    "host.docker.internal:8000",  # UI backend for messaging
]
```

---

## CLI Commands

### Single-container launch and lifecycle

```
keel-containers launch <session-id>          # foreground attached to current terminal
keel-containers launch <session-id> --detach # background
keel-containers stop <session-id>
keel-containers list
keel-containers status <session-id>
keel-containers cleanup <session-id>
```

The `--iterm` flag has been removed from `launch`. The user already runs the CLI from a terminal — spawning another one to attach to the same agent is pointless. Default is foreground; `--detach` runs the container in the background.

### Batch launch

```
keel-containers launch-batch <session-id> [<session-id> ...]  # all detached
keel-containers launch-batch <session-id> [<session-id> ...] --terminal  # spawn one terminal per agent
```

`launch-batch` brings up multiple containers at once. With `--terminal`, the configured terminal launcher (see below) opens a tab/window per agent.

### Open a terminal for a running container

```
keel-containers terminal <session-id>      # opens a terminal attached to one container
keel-containers terminal-all               # opens terminals for all running containers
```

These replace the removed `iterm` and `iterm-all` subcommands. Both use the configured terminal launcher and run `docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash` inside.

### Terminal launcher — configurable

Different users use different terminals. The launcher is configured in `~/.keel-containers/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# ~/.keel-containers/config.yaml
terminal_launcher:
  command: iterm           # iterm | terminal | ghostty | alacritty | kitty | wezterm | tmux | none
  # OR fully custom:
  custom: |
    osascript -e 'tell application "Ghostty" to ...'
```

Built-in launchers:

| Name | macOS | Linux | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
| `iterm` | osascript → iTerm2 | n/a | macOS only |
| `terminal` | osascript → Terminal.app | n/a | macOS only |
| `ghostty` | osascript → Ghostty | xdotool / dbus | cross-platform |
| `alacritty` | `alacritty -e ...` | `alacritty -e ...` | spawns new windows |
| `kitty` | `kitty @ launch ...` | same | uses kitty remote control |
| `wezterm` | `wezterm cli spawn ...` | same | |
| `tmux` | new tmux window | new tmux window | requires existing tmux session |
| `none` | no terminal spawning | no terminal spawning | run all `--detach` |

If no config file is present, the default is `none` (run detached, user opens terminals manually if desired). Users can opt in to a specific launcher.

For fully custom setups, set `terminal_launcher.custom` with a shell command template. The launcher abstraction passes the `docker exec` command in via a placeholder.

---

## Orchestration Runtime

A new Python module `keel_containers/core/orchestration.py` is the orchestration runtime. It **lives in keel-containers but is configured by the project repo**. The patterns and hooks live in `<project>/orchestration/`. The runtime reads them on every event.

This matches the broader principle: the project repo is the configuration; `keel-containers` is the engine that executes that configuration.

### Key functions

- **`load_pattern(project_dir, name)`** — reads `<project>/orchestration/<name>.yaml`
- **`merge_overrides(pattern, session)`** — applies session-level overrides on top of project default
- **`evaluate_event(pattern, event, ctx)`** — looks up matching event, evaluates conditions, returns action list
- **`run_action(action, ctx)`** — executes a built-in action: `re_engage`, `launch_agent`, `send_message`, `wait_for`, `merge_pr`, `notify_human`, `require_artifact`, `update_session_status_summary`, `publish_to_ui`, plus `if/then/else` branches
- **`call_hook(hook_name, event, ctx)`** — invokes a Python hook from `<project>/orchestration/hooks/`

### Event sources

The orchestrator reacts to events from:

- File watcher on the project repo (issue/session/artifact changes)
- WebSocket messages from running containers (agent status updates)
- GitHub webhook polling (CI status, PR reviews)
- MCP messages from agents (plan ready, status updates, blocking questions)

### Deterministic runtime + Claude-driven PM agent

The PM agent (a Claude-driven container) handles judgement-heavy decisions: plan review, scope changes, conflict resolution. The deterministic orchestrator handles the simple event → action flows defined in the YAML pattern. They work together — the YAML rules can call out to the PM agent (via `launch_agent`) for any decision that needs reasoning.

---

## PM Agent Project-Repo PR Review

Coding agents push PRs to two places:

- **Target repos** — `web-app-backend`, `web-app-infrastructure`, etc. — containing the actual code changes.
- **Project repo** — containing updates to issues, sessions, concept nodes, comments, and artifacts produced during the session.

The PM agent's job is to review the **project-repo PRs** before they land. Code-PR review on target repos is handled by the verifier agent (separate flow).

### Checks

When a coding agent opens a PR to the project repo, the PM agent runs the following checks:

1. **Schema validation** — every changed YAML file passes pydantic validation
2. **Reference integrity** — all `[[node-id]]` references in changed files resolve to existing nodes
3. **Status transition validity** — issue/session status transitions match `project.yaml` rules
4. **Required-fields check** — issues have all required frontmatter (executor, verifier, repo, etc.)
5. **Markdown structure** — issue bodies have all required sections (Context, Acceptance criteria, etc.)
6. **Concept node freshness** — newly added/edited nodes have valid `source` (file exists, hash computed)
7. **Artifact presence** — sessions in `completed` state have all artifacts marked `required: true` in `templates/artifacts/manifest.yaml` (default set: `plan.md`, `task-checklist.md`, `verification-checklist.md`, `recommended-testing-plan.md`, `post-completion-comments.md`)
8. **No orphan additions** — new nodes are referenced by at least one issue or marked `planned`
9. **Comment provenance** — new comments have valid author + type
10. **Project standards** — free-form rules in `templates/standards.md`

### Outcomes

- **All pass** → PM posts an approval review on the PR. If `auto_merge_on_pass` is enabled in the active orchestration pattern, the PM also merges.
- **Any fail** → PM posts a `request_changes` review with specific feedback per failing check, and the orchestrator re-engages the coding agent with the failures as context.

### Invocation

The PM agent invokes the keel CLI:

```
keel pm review-pr <pr-number> --repo <project-repo>
```

This command runs all checks against the diff, prints results, and returns a non-zero exit code on any failure. The PM agent (containerised or not) calls it directly.
