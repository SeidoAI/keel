# Overarching Plan: Agent Development Platform

## Vision

A single Python package — `keel` — that replaces Linear + Notion + manual agent orchestration with a fully autonomous, git-native agent development platform. Three modules within one package:

| Module | What it does | Install |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **keel.core** + **keel.cli** | Data layer: issues, concept graph, dependencies, status — all as files in git. CLI for validation, status, and atomic operations. | `pip install tripwire` (or `pip install tripwire[projects]` for minimal) |
| **keel.ui** | Visibility layer: web dashboard for projects, issues, graph, live agent status | Included in `pip install tripwire` |
| **keel.containers** | Execution layer: containerised Claude Code agents with strict egress, repo isolation | Included in `pip install tripwire` |

```
pip install tripwire              # everything (projects + UI + containers)
pip install tripwire[projects]    # minimal: CLI, validator, skills only
```

**The primary user of `keel` is Claude Code with the project-manager skill loaded.** Humans interact with the system *through* the agent, not directly via the CLI. The CLI is intentionally minimal — read commands, validation, and atomic operations only — because agents create issues, nodes, and sessions by writing files directly via their `Write` tool, not by invoking CLI mutation commands. The PM skill (shipped in `templates/skills/project-manager/` and copied to the project repo on init) is the linchpin: it teaches agents how to work with the file layout, schemas, references, and the validation gate.

## The Project Repo is the Source of Truth

This is the central design principle that informs everything else in this document. Every other section should be read in light of it.

**The project repo is the single source of truth for everything customisable** — skills, agent definitions, orchestration patterns, templates, enums, artifact specs, standards, and project config. If an agent reads it, it lives in the project repo.

**`keel` ships defaults that get COPIED into the project repo on init.** The package contains canonical reference templates under `templates/` (skills, agent definitions, enums, orchestration patterns, artifact templates, etc.). `tripwire init` copies the entire `templates/` tree into the new project. After init, the project owns them — they are version-controlled in git, edited freely, and the package is no longer their source of truth.

**`keel.containers` is a thin runtime that READS from the project repo.** It ships no skills, no templates, no defaults of its own. When a container launches, it clones the project repo, mounts the relevant skills from `<project>/.claude/skills/`, reads the orchestration pattern from `<project>/orchestration/`, reads enums from `<project>/enums/`, and reads artifact templates from `<project>/templates/artifacts/`. The runtime executes whatever the project repo says.

**`keel.ui` reads from the project repo for everything customisable** — issue templates, enums (for status colors, type icons), artifact manifests (for which artifact viewers to show), orchestration patterns (for which approval gates exist).

**Everything is auditable.** Because the project repo is git, every customisation — every change to a skill, every new orchestration pattern, every enum tweak — is a commit. Two projects can run completely different agent configurations side-by-side, each fully under their own version control.

This principle is what makes the system pluggable: the execution runtime (`keel.containers`) stays small and stable; the configuration (the project repo) is open for any team to customise without forking the runtime.

**The PM skill is the linchpin for agent-driven workflows.** Because the primary user of `keel` is Claude Code with the PM skill loaded (not a human typing CLI commands), the quality of the skill — its workflow references, schema documentation, examples, and anti-patterns — determines whether the whole system works. The skill ships from `keel/templates/skills/project-manager/` as a reference, gets copied into `<project>/.claude/skills/project-manager/` on init, and is then owned and customisable per project. Detailed skill design lives in `docs/keel-plan.md`.

## How the Modules Interact

All three modules live in one package and import each other directly —
no subprocess calls or HTTP between them.

### 1. keel.core → keel.containers

The project repo defines **what** work to do. `keel.containers` reads it to know **how** to execute.

- `sessions/<id>/session.yaml` defines which issues, which repo, which agent type
- `project.yaml` defines repos (with GitHub slugs for cloning), base branches
- `issues/<KEY>.yaml` contains the full issue spec the agent will work from
- `.claude/skills/project-manager/` contains the PM agent skill

Agent definitions live in `agents/` directory — see "Agent Definitions" section below for the full schema. Sessions reference agents by ID.

### 2. keel.containers → keel.core

Agents write back to the project repo via git (PRs):
- Status transitions (issue status updated in YAML)
- Comments (new files in `docs/issues/<KEY>/comments/`)
- Concept nodes (new/updated files in `graph/nodes/`)
- Completion artifacts (`docs/issues/<KEY>/developer.md`)

All changes happen via PRs to the project repo — the PM agent reviews them.

### 3. keel.core + keel.containers → keel.ui

The UI reads from two sources:

**From the filesystem (via keel.core):**
- Issue list, statuses, priorities, dependencies
- Concept graph nodes and edges
- Agent session definitions
- Project config, phase, validation status

**From keel.containers runtime:**
- Which containers are running right now
- Which issue each container is working on
- Container health, logs, resource usage
- Terminal session access (for human intervention)

---

## Agent Definitions (lives in keel)

Agents are defined in the project repo under `agents/`. This is distinct from sessions (which assign issues to agents) — agent definitions describe **what kind of agent** something is, what runtime it uses, and what permissions it has.

```yaml

### Key design decisions

**Why agent definitions live in the project repo (not in keel-containers):**
- They are project-specific — different projects may have different agent configs
- They are versioned in git — changes to permissions are auditable
- The PM agent can read them to know what agents are available for dispatching
- Sessions reference agent definitions by `id`

**GitHub identities — why separate bot accounts:**
- Each agent type gets its own GitHub identity (username + email)
- Commits are attributed to the right agent: `git log` shows "seido-backend-bot" vs "seido-verifier-bot"
- Scoped tokens per agent: backend bot gets read-write, verifier gets read-only
- Branch protection rules on `main` and `test` prevent direct pushes — agents can only push feature branches and open PRs
- This is enforced at the GitHub level, not just in the container — even if an agent tries to push to main, GitHub rejects it

**Runtime abstraction — not locked to Claude Code:**
- `runtime: claude-code` — runs Claude Code CLI inside the container
- `runtime: langgraph` — runs a LangGraph agent (e.g., the ml-business-agent pattern)
- `runtime: custom` — runs an arbitrary entrypoint script
- The container image varies by runtime, but the workspace layout is the same
- For LangGraph agents: the container starts the graph server, feeds it the issue as input, collects output
- For custom: user provides an entrypoint script in the agent definition

**PM agent orchestration — how it deploys other agents:**
- The PM agent can run from a container OR from a local Claude Code session (just load the skill)
- When containerised, the PM has access to `keel-containers` CLI
- The `orchestration` section defines what the PM is allowed to launch
- `max_concurrent_agents` prevents runaway agent spawning
- `auto_launch_on_status` defines event-driven automation (what triggers agent launches)
- This is the key to removing human-in-the-loop: PM watches for status transitions and auto-dispatches

**PM agent project-repo PR review responsibility:**

In addition to dispatching coding agents, the PM agent is responsible for reviewing PRs to the **project repo** itself. Coding agents push PRs to two destinations: the *target repos* (web-app-backend, etc.) AND the *project repo* (containing updates to issues, sessions, concept nodes, comments, and artifacts). The PM agent reviews the project-repo PRs.

When a coding agent opens a PR to the project repo, the PM agent runs a checklist:

1. **Schema validation** — every changed YAML file passes pydantic validation
2. **Reference integrity** — all `[[node-id]]` references in changed files resolve to existing nodes
3. **Status transition validity** — issue/session status transitions follow `project.yaml` rules
4. **Required-fields check** — issues have all required frontmatter (executor, verifier, repos, etc.)
5. **Markdown structure** — issue bodies have all required sections
6. **Concept node freshness** — newly added/edited nodes have valid `source` (file exists, hash computed)
7. **Artifact presence** — sessions in `completed` state have all artifacts marked `required: true` in `templates/artifacts/manifest.yaml`
8. **No orphan additions** — new nodes are referenced by at least one issue or marked `planned`
9. **Comment provenance** — new comments have valid author + type
10. **Project standards** — checks defined in `templates/standards.md`

The PM approves the PR only when all checks pass. If `auto_merge_on_pass` is enabled in the project's orchestration pattern, the PM can optionally merge the PR automatically. If any check fails, the PM posts a `request_changes` review with specific feedback per failed check, and the orchestrator re-engages the coding agent with the failing checks as context.

**Documentation as container input:**

Documentation can be mounted into a container at three levels, all merged together when the container launches:

- **Agent level** (existing) — `agents/<id>.yaml` `context.docs` lists doc paths every container launched with that agent gets. This is the agent's base context (e.g. backend-coder always wants the API contract and architecture docs).
- **Issue level** (NEW) — `issues/<KEY>.yaml` has a `docs:` frontmatter field for extra doc paths specific to that issue (e.g. an auth issue mounts the JWT spec and a relevant ADR).
- **Session level** (NEW) — `sessions/<id>.yaml` has a `docs:` frontmatter field for extra doc paths specific to that session (e.g. a multi-issue session that needs a cross-service flow doc that no single issue requires).

**Merge rule**: union of all three lists, deduplicated by path. All mounted **read-only** at `/workspace/docs/<path>`.

```yaml
# agents/backend-coder.yaml — base context
context:
  docs:
    - docs/api-contract.yaml
    - docs/architecture/

# issues/SEI-42.yaml — extra docs for this specific issue
docs:
  - docs/auth/jwt-spec.md
  - docs/decisions/DEC-003.md

# sessions/api-endpoints-core.yaml — extra docs for this multi-issue session
docs:
  - docs/integration/cross-service-flow.md
```

This solves the alignment problem at every granularity: agents always read the latest docs from the project repo, and the operator can scope documentation precisely to where it's needed without bloating every container with everything. The concept graph `[[references]]` in docs and issues mean agents can navigate to the actual code.

### How sessions reference agents

Sessions point to an agent definition and carry runtime state across re-engagements:

```yaml
# sessions/api-endpoints-core.yaml
---
id: api-endpoints-core
name: "Agent A: Auth + User Model"
agent: backend-coder                  # references agents/backend-coder.yaml
issues: [SEI-40, SEI-42]

# Multi-repo: sessions can target multiple repos. All repos are equal — no
# primary. The agent treats them symmetrically and may branch and PR in any.
repos:
  - repo: SeidoAI/web-app-backend
    base_branch: test
    branch: claude/SEI-40-auth        # set after first push
    pr_number: 42                     # set after PR opened
  - repo: SeidoAI/web-app-infrastructure
    base_branch: test
    branch: claude/SEI-40-tf-secrets
    pr_number: 18

status: waiting_for_ci                # see "Session Status Lifecycle" below

# Runtime state — persisted across container restarts
runtime_state:
  claude_session_id: "sess_abc123"    # for claude --resume
  langgraph_thread_id: null           # for langgraph checkpoint resume
  workspace_volume: "vol-api-endpoints-core"  # Docker volume preserving workspace
  # one runtime_state.repos entry tracks per-repo branch and PR;
  # the canonical branch/pr_number are stored in the repos[] list above

# Re-engagement history — append-only log of every container start
engagements:
  - started_at: "2026-03-26T14:00:00"
    trigger: initial_launch
    ended_at: "2026-03-26T16:30:00"
    outcome: pr_opened

  - started_at: "2026-03-26T17:15:00"
    trigger: ci_failure
    context: "Lint failure in src/api/auth.py:45 — ruff E302"
    ended_at: "2026-03-26T17:25:00"
    outcome: fix_pushed

  - started_at: "2026-03-26T18:00:00"
    trigger: verifier_rejection

## Controlling Everything from the UI

The UI is the human's primary interface for the entire platform. Key control flows:

**Launch agents from UI:**
1. Human selects issues on the Kanban board
2. Clicks "Launch Agent" → UI shows available agent definitions that match (by repo, executor type)
3. Human picks agent + confirms → backend calls `keel-containers launch`
4. Container starts, iTerm tab opens, agent monitor shows live status

**PM agent auto-orchestration (visible in UI):**
1. PM agent proposes a launch plan → visible as a PR in the UI
2. Human approves → PM agent launches agents for the first set
3. UI shows session progress: which agents are running, which issues are in progress
4. As agents complete → PM agent auto-launches the next set (if plan approved)
5. Human can intervene at any point: stop agent, reassign issue, modify plan

**Manual actions from UI:**
- Stop/restart any agent container
- Open iTerm to any container
- Approve/reject PRs (calls `gh pr merge` or `gh pr close`)
- Edit issue status (drag-and-drop on Kanban)
- Launch validation (`tripwire validate`)
- View and approve PM agent plans
- Delete branches, cleanup containers

---

## Feedback Loops & Agent Re-engagement

### The principle

**Agent context is valuable. Never throw it away. Persist across re-engagements.**

When a coding agent opens a PR and exits, it has built up a mental model of the codebase, the issue, and decisions it made. When CI fails or a reviewer requests changes, the agent should resume with that full context — not start from scratch.

### State persistence model

The container is disposable. The agent state is not.

- **Docker volume** persists the workspace (`/workspace/repo`, `/workspace/project`, `/workspace/.claude/`) across container restarts. Named per-session: `vol-api-endpoints-core`.
- **Claude Code sessions** resume via `claude --resume --session-id <id>`. The session ID is stored in the session YAML.
- **LangGraph checkpoints** resume via thread ID from the checkpoint store. The thread ID is stored in the session YAML.
- **Session YAML** (`sessions/<id>.yaml`) is the persistence anchor — it tracks runtime state, re-engagement history, and current status.

### Session status lifecycle

```
planned → active → waiting_for_ci ──→ re_engaged → active → waiting_for_ci → ...
                 → waiting_for_review → re_engaged → active → ...
                 → waiting_for_deploy → re_engaged → active → ...
                 → completed
                 → failed
```

Statuses:
- `planned` — session defined but not launched yet
- `active` — container running, agent working
- `waiting_for_ci` — PR opened, waiting for CI results
- `waiting_for_review` — CI passed, waiting for verifier/human review
- `waiting_for_deploy` — merged, waiting for deployment result
- `re_engaged` — feedback received, container re-launching (transient)
- `completed` — all issues done, artifacts delivered
- `failed` — unrecoverable failure, human intervention needed

### Re-engagement flow

```
Feedback event (CI failure, review comment, deploy failure, stale node, ...)
    │
    ▼
PM agent or GitHub Action detects event
    │
    ▼
Writes re-engagement entry to session YAML:
  - trigger type (ci_failure, verifier_rejection, human_review_changes, ...)
  - context (error output, review comments, deploy logs, ...)
  - updates session status → re_engaged
    │
    ▼
Calls: keel-containers launch <session-id>
    │
    ▼
Container starts with SAME Docker volume (workspace preserved)
    │
    ▼
Agent resumes with full prior context + new re-engagement prompt:
  "You are being re-engaged. Trigger: ci_failure. Context: <error details>.
   Read the PR comments and CI results, then fix the issues."
```

### Feedback sources → re-engagement triggers

| Source | Trigger type | Session status while waiting | Context injected |
|--------|-------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Lint failure | `ci_failure` | `waiting_for_ci` | Failed check name, file, line, error |
| Test failure | `ci_failure` | `waiting_for_ci` | Test name, assertion error, stack trace |
| Build failure | `ci_failure` | `waiting_for_ci` | Build step, error output |
| Type check failure | `ci_failure` | `waiting_for_ci` | File, line, expected vs actual type |
| Verifier rejects | `verifier_rejection` | `waiting_for_review` | Which criteria failed, verifier's review |
| Human requests changes | `human_review_changes` | `waiting_for_review` | Review comments, file/line comments |
| Bug reviewer finding | `bug_found` | `waiting_for_review` | Bug description, affected code, severity |
| Deploy failure | `deploy_failure` | `waiting_for_deploy` | Deploy logs, which service, error |
| Smoke test failure | `deploy_failure` | `waiting_for_deploy` | Test name, expected vs actual |
| Concept node stale | `stale_reference` | any waiting state | Which `[[node]]` changed, diff |
| PM scope change | `scope_change` | any waiting state | Updated issue body, PM's comment |
| Merge conflict | `merge_conflict` | `waiting_for_ci` | Conflicting files, which branch |
| Dependency conflict | `dependency_conflict` | any waiting state | Upstream change details |

## Orchestration Patterns

### The concept

Orchestration patterns codify *who acts when*: when does the human approve vs the PM auto-act, is there a plan gate, when does the verifier run, does a green PR auto-merge. Different projects — and even different sessions within the same project — need different patterns. Hardcoding one workflow doesn't fit reality, so orchestration is configurable.

### Patterns live in the project repo

Patterns are YAML files (with optional Python hook scripts as an escape hatch for complex logic), all stored under `<project>/orchestration/`. This is consistent with the broader principle: anything customisable lives in the project repo.

```
my-project/
├── orchestration/
│   ├── default.yaml       # project default
│   ├── strict.yaml        # named alternative — more human gates
│   ├── fast.yaml          # named alternative — auto-everything
│   └── hooks/             # Python hook scripts (optional)
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── custom_verifier.py
```

### Hierarchy: Project → Session

Just two tiers, kept deliberately small to keep the mental model simple.

- **Project default**: `project.yaml` declares which pattern is the default (e.g. `default_pattern: default`) and sets project-wide flags like `plan_approval_required` and `auto_merge_on_pass`.
- **Session-level overrides**: a session YAML can pick a different pattern entirely OR override individual fields. Session fields *win* over project fields — straight field-level override, no deeper merging.

```yaml
# sessions/critical-prod-fix.yaml — wants extra gates for this one session
orchestration:
  pattern: default
  overrides:
    plan_approval_required: true
    auto_merge_on_pass: false
```

### Hybrid format: declarative YAML + optional Python hooks

The patterns are declarative YAML rules mapping events to actions. For complex logic that doesn't fit declarative rules, Python hook scripts under `orchestration/hooks/` act as an escape hatch — the YAML can call out to a hook by name and the hook returns a decision dict.

A short example pattern (full vocabulary and worked examples in `keel-plan.md`):

```yaml
# orchestration/default.yaml
name: default
description: PM auto-orchestrates with human gates only on plan approval

events:
  pr_opened:
    actions:
      - launch_agent: verifier
      - on_verifier_pass:
          - if: project.auto_merge_on_pass
            then: [ merge_pr ]
            else: [ notify_human ]

  ci_failure:
    actions:
      - re_engage: { trigger: ci_failure, context_from: ci_logs }
```

### Where the runtime lives

**Critical**: the orchestration *runtime* lives in `keel-containers/core/orchestration.py`, not in `keel`. The patterns and hooks live in the project repo. The runtime reads them on every event.

This is exactly the same shape as the rest of the system: the project repo is the configuration; `keel-containers` is the engine that executes that configuration. The orchestrator reacts to events from the file watcher on the project repo, WebSocket messages from running containers, GitHub webhook polling, and MCP messages from agents.

### PM agent vs deterministic orchestrator

The deterministic orchestrator handles simple event → action flows (CI failed, re-engage; PR opened, launch verifier; verifier passed, notify human). The PM agent — a Claude-driven container — handles judgement-heavy decisions (plan review, scope changes, conflict resolution, project-repo PR review). The two work together: the orchestrator routes events deterministically and calls the PM agent when something needs reasoning.

Full pattern detail, the complete action vocabulary, hook signatures, and worked examples are in `docs/keel-plan.md`.

## Session Artifacts

### The concept

A session produces structured outputs as it runs. These are the agent's plan, its task tracking, its verification checklist, the testing plan it wants reviewers to follow, and its post-completion reflection. The defaults are five artifacts:

```
sessions/api-endpoints-core/artifacts/
├── plan.md                      # written at session start (the agent's internal plan)
├── task-checklist.md            # updated continuously as work progresses
├── verification-checklist.md    # generated at planning, confirmed at completion
├── recommended-testing-plan.md  # what reviewers/QA should test
└── post-completion-comments.md  # final reflection: decisions, gotchas, follow-ups
```

These are written to `sessions/<id>/artifacts/` in the project repo and committed via the agent's PR to the project repo.

### Customisable per project

The five artifacts above are *defaults*, not a hardcoded list. Each artifact has a template in the project repo (under `templates/artifacts/`), and projects can add their own artifacts, remove ones they don't need, or reshape templates entirely. The active set is declared in `templates/artifacts/manifest.yaml`:

```yaml
artifacts:
  - name: plan
    file: plan.md
    template: plan.md.j2
    produced_at: planning
    required: true
    approval_gate: false           # set true to require human approval before agent proceeds
  # ...
```

The PM agent's PR-review checklist asserts that all `required: true` artifacts are present before approving a session-completion PR. The skill instructions for coding agents tell them to read `templates/artifacts/manifest.yaml` to know what they must produce.

### Plan approval gate

The plan approval gate is configurable. Set `approval_gate: true` on `plan.md` (or any artifact) to make the agent stop after producing it and send a `plan_approval` message. The orchestrator only re-engages the agent once a human approval is received. Projects that prefer fully autonomous agents leave it `false`.

### UI surfaces

The UI surfaces every artifact in the manifest as a tab/section in the session detail view, with rendered Markdown. Artifacts with `approval_gate: true` show in a plan-approval queue. The task checklist drives a progress bar on session cards.

Full detail (template format, manifest schema, session-level artifact overrides, examples of each artifact) is in `docs/keel-plan.md`.

---

## Agent ↔ Human Messaging

### Principle

Messages between agents and humans are **direct HTTP** from the container to the UI backend. Not git. Messages are ephemeral communication for real-time coordination. The permanent record (decisions, outcomes) ends up in issue comments and completion artifacts which are in git. A message log is persisted to the project repo when a session completes — but individual messages are never committed as they happen.

### How it works

```
Container                    Host machine                Browser
┌──────────┐    HTTP POST    ┌───────────────┐  WebSocket  ┌─────────┐

                                     │
                          On session complete:
                          Write messages.yaml
                          to project repo + commit
```

### MCP server in containers

Each container runs a tiny MCP server that exposes two tools to the agent:

**`send_message`** — agent sends a message to the human:
```json
{
  "name": "send_message",
  "description": "Send a message to the human operator via the project dashboard",
  "parameters": {
    "type": { "enum": ["question", "plan_approval", "progress", "stuck", "escalation", "handover", "fyi", "status"] },
    "priority": { "enum": ["blocking", "informational"] },
    "body": { "type": "string", "description": "Markdown-formatted message body" }
  }
}
```

**`check_messages`** — agent checks for pending responses:
```json
{
  "name": "check_messages",
  "description": "Check if the human has responded to any of your messages",
  "parameters": {}
}
```

The MCP server is a single Python file (~80 lines) that proxies these tool calls to `http://host.docker.internal:8000/api/messages`. The session ID is injected via `AGENT_SESSION_ID` env var.

Fallback for non-MCP agents: `/usr/local/bin/agent-msg` shell script (curl wrapper).

### Message types

| Type | When | Priority | Agent behavior after sending |
|------|------|----------|------------------------------|
| `plan_approval` | Before starting implementation | `blocking` | Stop, exit, wait for re-engagement |
| `question` | Needs human input to proceed | `blocking` | Stop, exit, wait for re-engagement |
| `stuck` | Tried multiple approaches, can't proceed | `blocking` | Stop, exit, wait for re-engagement |
| `escalation` | Needs elevated permissions or scope change | `blocking` | Stop, exit, wait for re-engagement |
| `handover` | Giving up, passing to human | `blocking` | Stop, exit |
| `progress` | Milestone reached | `informational` | Keep working |
| `fyi` | Found something interesting, not blocking | `informational` | Keep working |
| `status` | Heartbeat update of agent state + 2-sentence summary (every ~5 min of active work and on every state transition) | `informational` | Keep working |

Status messages have a structured body: `{ state, summary }` where `state` is from the customisable `agent_state` enum (default values: `investigating`, `planning`, `awaiting_plan_approval`, `implementing`, `testing`, `debugging`, `refactoring`, `documenting`, `self_verifying`, `blocked`, `handed_off`, `done`). The orchestrator updates `session.current_state` from the latest status message; the UI surfaces it as a live badge on each session card. See `keel-containers.md` for the full schema.

### Response flow and re-engagement

When human responds to a blocking message:
1. Human types response in UI → `POST /api/messages/:id/respond`
2. UI backend stores response in SQLite
3. UI backend calls `tripwire session re-engage <id> --trigger human_response --context "..."`
4. `keel-containers launch <id>` restarts the container
5. Agent resumes, calls `check_messages` MCP tool, reads the response

New re-engagement triggers:
- `human_response` — generic response to a question
- `plan_approved` — plan was approved (with optional notes)
- `plan_rejected` — plan was rejected (with feedback)

### Message log persistence

Messages live in SQLite for real-time delivery. When a session completes or fails, the UI backend writes the full conversation to `sessions/<session-id>/messages.yaml` in the project repo and commits it. This is the permanent audit trail.

```yaml
# sessions/api-endpoints-core/messages.yaml (committed on session complete)
- id: "001"
  direction: agent_to_human
  type: plan_approval
  priority: blocking
  author: backend-coder
  created_at: "2026-03-26T14:05:00"
  body: |
    ## Implementation Plan
    1. Add token validation middleware...
  response:
    author: maia
    created_at: "2026-03-26T14:12:00"
    body: "Approved. Also validate email format."
    decision: approved

- id: "002"
  direction: agent_to_human
  type: question
  priority: blocking
  author: backend-coder
  created_at: "2026-03-26T15:30:00"
  body: "Which validation approach? Option A or B?"
  response:
    author: maia
    created_at: "2026-03-26T15:45:00"
    body: "Go with Option A."
```

## Project 1: keel (Data Layer)

**Status:** Detailed plan exists at `docs/keel-plan.md`

**Summary:** Git-native PM with concept graph. Installable Python package with CLI.

**Key outputs consumed by other projects:**
- `project.yaml` — project config, repo registry, agent permissions, status flow
- `issues/` — issue files (YAML frontmatter + Markdown body with `[[references]]`)
- `graph/nodes/` — concept nodes with content hashes for staleness detection
- `sessions/` — agent session definitions (dependency-based parallelism)
- `.claude/skills/project-manager/` — PM agent skill for generated repos

**CLI:** `tripwire init`, `issue`, `node`, `refs`, `status`, `graph`, `session`

---

## Project 2: keel-containers (Execution Layer)

### The problems this solves

From the notes:
1. **"Claude requires WAY too many approvals"** — containerisation means agents can't damage the host. You approve the container definition once, then let it run.
2. **"Feedback loops are slow with human-in-the-loop"** — agents run autonomously in containers, CI failures auto-route back to the agent.
3. **"Cloud agents are a necessity"** — define startup script, context, MCP servers. Container IS the reproducible execution environment.
4. **"Need monitoring for agents superior to Claude Code"** — UI shows all containers, their status, and you can SSH in via iTerm2.

### What it does

`keel-containers` is a Python CLI that:
1. **Launches Docker containers** with Claude Code + a repo clone + skills + MCP servers
2. **Enforces strict egress** via Docker network policies (iptables/firewall rules)
3. **Reports container status** via a lightweight status file or API
4. **Integrates with iTerm2** to open terminal tabs for each running agent

```

### Container lifecycle

```
keel-containers launch <session-id>
  1. Read session from project repo: sessions/<session-id>.yaml
  2. Read agent definition from project repo: agents/<agent-id>.yaml
  3. Configure git identity (agent's GitHub username + email + scoped token)
  4. Clone all target repos (from session.repos[]) into /workspace/repos/<repo-name>/
  5. Clone project repo into container workspace at /workspace/project/
  6. Mount merged docs (union of agent + issue + session docs) read-only
     into /workspace/docs/
  7. Mount skills from <project>/.claude/skills/ into the container workspace
     (the project repo is the source of truth — keel-containers ships none)
  8. Inject API keys (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, scoped GITHUB_TOKEN — from host env)
  9. Configure egress firewall (Docker network rules from agent permissions)
  10. Select runtime entrypoint:
      - claude-code: start Claude Code with issue as prompt
      - langgraph: start LangGraph server with issue as input
      - custom: run user-provided entrypoint script
  11. Write container metadata to ~/.keel-containers/active/<session-id>.json
```

### Egress enforcement

Three levels of network control:

**Level 1 — Docker network isolation:**
- Each container on its own bridge network
- No inter-container communication by default
- Host network access blocked

**Level 2 — Egress whitelist (iptables/nftables):**
- Only allow connections to domains in `agents.<role>.permissions.network`
- DNS resolution allowed only for whitelisted domains
- All other outbound traffic dropped

**Level 3 — API-level permissions:**
- `gh` configured with a scoped token (read-only vs read-write per role)
- `gcloud` configured with a scoped service account (or not present at all)
- No ambient credentials from host — everything explicitly injected

### Runtime entrypoints

**Claude Code runtime** (primary):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /workspace/repo
git config user.name "$AGENT_GIT_USERNAME"
git config user.email "$AGENT_GIT_EMAIL"

ISSUE_KEY=$(cat /workspace/config/issue_key)
ISSUE_FILE="/workspace/project/issues/${ISSUE_KEY}.yaml"

# Start Claude Code with the issue as context
claude -p "You are working on issue ${ISSUE_KEY}. Read the issue at ${ISSUE_FILE}. The project repo is at /workspace/project/. Follow the skill instructions."

echo '{"state": "completed", "exit_code": '$?'}' > /tmp/agent-status.json
```

For interactive monitoring (human attaches via iTerm2):
```bash
claude --resume
```

**LangGraph runtime:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /workspace/repo
git config user.name "$AGENT_GIT_USERNAME"
git config user.email "$AGENT_GIT_EMAIL"

# Start LangGraph agent with issue context as input
python -m agent_server \
  --issue-file "/workspace/project/issues/${ISSUE_KEY}.yaml" \
  --project-dir "/workspace/project" \
  --repo-dir "/workspace/repo"
```

**Custom runtime:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# User-provided entrypoint from agent definition
# Gets same workspace layout and environment variables
exec /workspace/config/entrypoint.sh
```

### iTerm2 integration

```python
# Uses osascript to control iTerm2
def open_iterm_tab(container_id: str, session_name: str):
    """Open a new iTerm2 tab attached to a running container."""
    script = f'''
    tell application "iTerm2"
        tell current window
            create tab with default profile
            tell current session of current tab
                set name to "{session_name}"
                write text "docker exec -it {container_id} /bin/bash"
            end tell
        end tell
    end tell
    '''
    subprocess.run(["osascript", "-e", script])
```

For multiple agents, open a split layout:
```
keel-containers launch-batch <session-id> [<session-id> ...] --terminal
# Opens a tab per agent in the batch using the configured terminal launcher
# Each tab is docker exec -it <container> bash
```

### CLI commands

```
keel-containers launch <session-id>
  --project-dir TEXT   Path to project repo [default: .]
  --detach             Run in background
  --dry-run            Show what would happen without launching

keel-containers launch-batch <session-id> [<session-id> ...]
  --project-dir TEXT   Path to project repo
  --terminal           Open a tab per agent using the configured launcher
  --max-parallel INT   Limit concurrent containers [default: unlimited]

keel-containers list
  --format TEXT        table/json [default: table]
  # Shows: session-id, issue, status, container-id, uptime, resource usage

keel-containers status <session-id>
  # Detailed status of one container: logs tail, resource usage, Claude Code state

keel-containers logs <session-id>
  --follow             Stream logs
  --tail INT           Last N lines [default: 50]

keel-containers stop <session-id>
  # Gracefully stop a container

keel-containers stop-all
  # Stop all running agent containers

keel-containers attach <session-id>
  # Docker exec into the container (interactive bash)

keel-containers terminal <session-id>
  # Open a terminal tab for an already-running container, using the configured launcher

keel-containers terminal-all
  # Open terminal tabs for all running containers

keel-containers cleanup
  # Remove stopped containers and dangling images
```

The terminal launcher is configurable via `~/.keel-containers/config.yaml` and supports `iterm`, `terminal` (Terminal.app), `ghostty`, `alacritty`, `kitty`, `wezterm`, `tmux`, or `none` (no terminal spawning — run all detached). For batch launches, `keel-containers launch-batch <session-ids> --terminal` opens a tab per agent using whichever launcher is configured.

### Container images

**Base image** (shared by all runtimes):
```dockerfile
# docker/Dockerfile.base — common tools for all agents
FROM ubuntu:24.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git curl wget jq openssh-client python3 python3-pip nodejs npm \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# GitHub CLI
RUN (curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | \
    dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg) && \
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y gh
RUN pip install tripwire
RUN mkdir -p /workspace/{repo,project,config,docs}
WORKDIR /workspace/repo
```

**Claude Code image** (extends base):
```dockerfile
# docker/Dockerfile.claude-code
FROM agent-base:latest
RUN npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
COPY entrypoint-claude.sh /usr/local/bin/
ENTRYPOINT ["entrypoint-claude.sh"]
```

**LangGraph image** (extends base):
```dockerfile
# docker/Dockerfile.langgraph
FROM agent-base:latest
RUN pip install langgraph langchain-google-genai
COPY entrypoint-langgraph.sh /usr/local/bin/
ENTRYPOINT ["entrypoint-langgraph.sh"]
```

`keel-containers` selects the right image based on the agent definition's `runtime` field.

## Project 3: keel-ui (Visibility Layer)

### The problems this solves

From the notes:
1. **"Need monitoring for agents that is superior to Claude Code"** — a UI showing where agents are, what's running, CI/CD status
2. **"Should be able to take manual actions"** — delete branch, approve plan, cleanup
3. **"Review Claude Code agent plans and approve — in a render of md files"** — Markdown rendering of plans/issues
4. **"Kanban board"** — issues by status
5. **"React Flow Graph"** — concept graph + dependency graph visualised

### Tech stack

Match existing Seido frontend patterns:
- **React 19** + **TypeScript 5.8** + **Vite 7**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** + **shadcn/ui**
- **XyFlow (React Flow)** — already used for graph viz in web-app
- **TanStack Query v5** — data fetching
- **Biome** — linting
- **Vitest** — testing

### Architecture

The UI is a **local development tool** (not a deployed web app). It runs on localhost and reads from:
1. **Git** (project repo on disk) — for issues, nodes, sessions, project config
2. **keel-containers status API** — for live container state
3. **GitHub API** — for PR status, CI checks

```

Why a backend API instead of reading git directly from the frontend:
- Git operations are filesystem I/O — can't do from a browser
- Docker status requires Docker SDK — server-side only
- GitHub API calls need auth tokens — don't expose to frontend
- WebSocket for live container updates

### UI views

**1. Project Switcher** (sidebar/header)
- List projects found in a configured root directory
- Show project name, key prefix, issue count
- Switch active project

**2. Kanban Board** (main view)
- Columns = statuses from project.yaml (configurable)
- Cards = issues, showing: key, title, priority badge, executor badge, agent name
- Cards colored by staleness (red border if referencing stale nodes)
- Drag-and-drop to change status (calls `tripwire issue update`)
- Filter by: executor, label, parent epic, assignee
- Active agent indicator on cards (green dot if a container is working on this issue)

**3. Concept Graph** (React Flow view)
- Nodes = issues (rectangles) + concept nodes (circles/diamonds by type)
- Edges = `[[references]]` (issue→node), `blocked_by` (issue→issue), `related` (node→node)
- Node coloring: by status (issues), by type (concept nodes), by staleness
- Click node → detail panel
- Filter by: node type, status, epic
- Layout: dagre for hierarchy, force-directed for exploration

**4. Issue Detail** (slide-over panel)
- Rendered Markdown body (with `[[references]]` as clickable links to nodes)
- Frontmatter fields in structured display
- Comments timeline
- Linked PRs and CI status (from GitHub API)
- Agent activity (if container is working on this issue)
- Actions: edit status, edit fields, open in editor

**5. Agent Monitor** (dedicated view or sidebar panel)
- List of running containers: session name, issue key, uptime, memory/CPU
- Status indicators: running, completed, failed, blocked
- Session dependency visualization: which sessions are active, which are complete
- Per-container actions:
  - "Open in iTerm" button (calls `keel-containers iterm`)
  - "View logs" (streams container logs)
  - "Stop" button
- History of completed sessions

**6. Actions Panel**
- Quick actions that would otherwise require terminal:
  - Delete branch + cleanup (`gh` + `git`)
  - Launch agent session (`keel-containers launch`)
  - Approve plan (merge PR via `gh pr merge`)
  - Run validation (`tripwire validate`)
  - Rebuild graph index (`tripwire refs rebuild`)

## Build Order and Dependencies

```
Phase 1: keel (data layer)
  ├── Python package: models, parser, store, validator, graph, CLI
  ├── Templates: project scaffold, PM agent skill, issue templates
  └── Deliverable: `pip install tripwire` works, `tripwire init` generates projects

Phase 2: keel-containers (execution layer)  ← depends on keel
  ├── Base Docker image with Claude Code + tools
  ├── Python package: container lifecycle, egress, workspace setup, CLI
  ├── iTerm2 integration
  └── Deliverable: `keel-containers launch <session>` runs an autonomous agent

Phase 3: keel-ui (visibility layer)  ← depends on both
  ├── Backend API (FastAPI, wraps git + docker + github)
  ├── React frontend (kanban, graph, agent monitor)
  └── Deliverable: `keel-ui` starts local dashboard

Each phase is independently useful:
  - Phase 1 alone: manage projects via CLI + git
  - Phase 1+2: agents run autonomously, monitor via terminal
  - Phase 1+2+3: full visual dashboard with agent monitoring
```

## Resolved Decisions

1. **Container runtime**: Any Docker-compatible runtime (Docker Desktop, OrbStack, Colima, Podman). We code against the `docker` CLI which is identical across all runtimes — zero overhead to support all of them. Recommend OrbStack for macOS (lighter than Docker Desktop).
2. **Remote execution**: Local Docker only for Phase 2. Cloud execution (Cloud Run, remote Docker) is a future extension.
3. **UI backend → keel**: Import `keel` as a Python library directly. Faster, type-safe, no subprocess overhead. The UI backend depends on `keel` as a pip dependency.
4. **Auth for UI**: None — local dev tool, bind to localhost only.
5. **Project discovery**: UI scans a configured root directory for projects (any directory containing `project.yaml`).
6. **Multi-repo sessions**: All repos in a session are equal (no primary). The agent treats them symmetrically — branches and PRs in any of them. Sessions declare a `repos:` array, not a single `repo:` field.
7. **Orchestration**: Hybrid YAML rules + Python hook scripts. Declarative YAML covers the simple event → action flows, hooks are an escape hatch for complex logic. Rules live in `<project>/orchestration/`, runtime in `keel-containers`.
8. **Customisation tiers**: Project → Session. Just 2 levels for orchestration overrides. No agent-tier or issue-tier overrides — keeps the mental model simple.
9. **Source of truth**: the project repo. `keel` ships defaults that get copied into the project on init; `keel-containers` is a thin runtime that reads from the project repo and ships no skills, no templates, no defaults of its own.
