# Keel backlog

Features evaluated in the v0.1 planning cycle but deferred.
See `docs/similar-tools.md` for the full analysis behind each.

## Future (revisit with evidence)

### F3: `keel timeline` — Fossil-style interleaved log
Chronological interleaving of git commits + issue/node/session
changes. Needs git-diff correlation work. Ship when corpus scale
justifies it.

### F17: Skill/methodology registry
Versioned reusable PM methodologies (startup-lean, enterprise-
compliance). Revisit after at least one external team uses Keel
in production.

### Selector grammar extensions (F9 v2)
Unions, negations, parenthesized expressions, cross-entity selectors.
Revisit after v0.1 selector usage patterns emerge.

### Container-native execution + verification skills
Full container delegation with execution/verification skills loaded
per-container. Depends on `keel.containers` infrastructure. See
SKILL.md delegation model section for the design intent.

### `keel plan` full workflow intent abstraction (F15 v2)
Refactor all PM workflows to separate intent from I/O via a
WorkflowIntent dataclass. Allows plan/apply for any workflow, not
just brief. Revisit when multiple workflows need dry-run support.

### Hybrid frontmatter + markdown-body artifacts for issues and nodes
Today issues and nodes are pure YAML; narrative content gets crammed
into multi-line `description:` / `definition:` fields with pipe
strings. Sessions already do the right thing: `session.yaml` holds
metadata, `plan.md` holds the narrative. Extending that pattern to
issues (`issues/<KEY>/issue.yaml` + `README.md` with required
sections like `## Context`, `## Scope`, `## Success criteria`) and
nodes (`nodes/<ID>.yaml` + `nodes/<ID>.md`) would let the narrative
live where agents reason about it best, while validation actually
gets *stronger* — the validator can require specific H2 section
headings, making stub-filling harder than it is today with a
one-line `description: "TBD"`.

Why deferred: the current YAML format is validatable, UI/container
consumers handle it fine, and agents can parse it even if they
don't prefer it. The upside is real but incremental, and the
rewrite touches every template, schema, and test. Revisit once we
have evidence that narrative-in-YAML is a measured drag on agent
reasoning quality (A/B experiment: one agent with hybrid artifacts,
one with current, measure decision quality on a shared task).

## Explicitly skipped

### F1: Property drawers (arbitrary metadata on entities)
Weakens the strict-schema bet. No user has requested it. If a
concrete use case emerges, model it as a new typed field on the
relevant entity kind instead of a generic drawer.

### F16: Explicit drift category in validator
Subsumed by F11 (named validator categories). Not a separate feature.
