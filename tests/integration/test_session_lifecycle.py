"""Full session lifecycle integration test (v0.6a).

Exercises the new primitives end-to-end through the CLI:
- scaffold a session manually (simulating what /pm-session-create does)
- derive the canonical branch name
- tripwire session check surfaces the missing handoff.yaml
- add handoff.yaml (simulating /pm-session-create stamp)
- tripwire session check passes
- tripwire validate passes (handoff required at queued, so we
  keep status=planned — launching would be a write operation the CLI
  doesn't do yet in v0.6a; /pm-session-queue's work lives in the
  slash-command body)
