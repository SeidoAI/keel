"""Tests for the packaged init templates' invariants.

These tests pin the templates that `tripwire init` stamps into a new
project against the CLI's source-of-truth lists. The most important
invariant: the session-status enum must contain every value the CLI
actually emits, otherwise newly-init'd projects hit
`enum/session_status not in active session_status enum` validation
errors the moment a session runs (the v0.7.6 §B regression).
