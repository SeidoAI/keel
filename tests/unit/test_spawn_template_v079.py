"""v0.7.9 §A5 — spawn template rewrite (defaults.yaml prompt_template).

Three requirements per spec:

1. Exit protocol is unconditional. NO "if there are two PRs..."
   conditional language. Both code PR AND PT PR MUST exist.

2. Self-review.md is an explicit pre-PT-PR step. Agent writes
   ``sessions/<sid>/self-review.md`` from the four-lens template before
   pushing the PT PR. PR comment is generated FROM the file.

3. CI-aware exit: agent polls ``gh pr checks <num> --watch`` after
   PR opens. After 3 failed-fix attempts, plain-text stop for PM.

These properties are asserted as invariants on the rendered prompt
template — substring searches kept loose enough to survive minor
copy edits but strict enough to catch a regression that drops the
mandatory language entirely.
