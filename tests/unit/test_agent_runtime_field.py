"""Agent yaml ``runtime`` field is honoured at spawn time (KUI-94 C4).

The agent template at ``agents/<agent_id>.yaml`` may declare
``runtime: claude`` or ``runtime: codex``. When the session's spawn
config doesn't pin ``invocation.runtime`` itself, the agent's
declared runtime is used; this is the per-agent override the spec
calls for.

Resolution ordering: session.spawn_config > project layers > agent
yaml > shipped default. The agent-yaml step is wired up via the new
``_apply_agent_yaml_overrides`` helper consumed by
``runtimes.prep.run_session_prep``.
