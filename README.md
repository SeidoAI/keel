> A git-native project tracker where the PM, coders, and verifier are AI agents.

Issues, architecture decisions, contracts, sessions — all YAML files in one
git repo, all cross-referenced, all validated by one 50 ms gate. Designed so
Claude Code (or any agent with file-write tools) can scope, track, and ship
real software projects without drifting from the code.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install keel
keel init my-project
cd my-project
claude
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/pm-scope Build a knowledge base with nodes and edges. Planning docs in ./plans/.
```

That's it. The agent reads your intent, scopes the project, writes the files,
validates its own work, and hands you a clean project to commit.

To see your project in the web dashboard:

```bash
keel ui
```

`keel init` auto-derives a key prefix from the project name (`my-project-cool` →
`MPC`), defaults to `main` as the base branch, and prompts for anything
non-obvious. Pass `--key-prefix`, `--base-branch`, or `--repos` to override.

### Minimal install

For CI pipelines or agents that only need the CLI (no web dashboard):

```bash
pip install keel[projects]
```

## What it does

- **One repo, everything inside.** Issues, concept nodes, sessions, skills, templates, enums — all version-controlled in git. No external DB, no SaaS.
- **Dual ID system.** Canonical UUID + atomic human key (`MP-42`), allocated with `fcntl.flock`. Branch-merge safe.
- **Content-hashed concept graph.** `[[node-id]]` references point at file regions with SHA-256 hashes. Move code → one node updates → every downstream issue catches up. Drift is a validation error.
- **14-check validation gate.** Schema, references, bidirectional consistency, status transitions, freshness, sequence drift. JSON output. Auto-fix subset. ~50 ms on a typical project. Rebuilds the graph cache as a side effect.
- **One-shot context brief.** `keel brief` gives an agent config, enums, templates, skill examples, next IDs, and the validation loop in a single tool-call result. The PM skill calls it automatically — you never have to.
- **Customisable session artifacts.** Plans, task checklists, verification checklists, testing plans, post-completion comments — per-project manifest, enforced by the validator.
- **Progressive-disclosure PM skill.** 33 reference files and canonical examples ship into every `init`. The agent reads the example, not the schema doc.

## Demo

```text
$ keel validate --strict
{
  "exit_code": 0,
  "errors": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "fixed": [],
  "cache_rebuilt": true,
  "duration_ms": 47
}

$ keel status --format=rich
my-project (MP)
  Issues: 23  (backlog=12, todo=8, in_progress=3)
  Concept nodes: 17 active, 2 stale
  Sessions: 4  (2 completed, 1 in_progress, 1 waiting_for_review)
  Critical path: MP-1 → MP-7 → MP-12 → MP-18  (length 4)

$ keel uuid --count 3
# Entity 1
a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4789-abcd-ef0123456789
# Entity 2
f9e8d7c6-b5a4-4321-8765-432109876543
# Entity 3
12345678-90ab-4cde-8f01-234567890abc
```

## How it works

Four principles. Each one is a deliberate choice.

**1. The project repo is the single source of truth.** Nothing lives in Linear, Notion, or a Google Doc. Clone the repo and you have the whole project.

**2. Agents are the primary users.** The CLI is intentionally minimal — read, validate, atomic ID allocation. Agents create issues and nodes by writing files directly with their `Write` tool, then run the validator.

**3. The concept graph is coherence.** Instead of prose like "the auth endpoint," issues reference `[[auth-token-endpoint]]` — a node file pointing at a specific file and line range with a stored content hash. When the code moves, one file updates. Stale hashes surface as validator errors.

**4. Validation is the gate.** Every agent loop ends with `keel validate --strict --format=json`. The same command rebuilds the graph cache incrementally. The loop is: write files → validate → fix → validate → commit.

**Why in-repo.** Project artifacts — decisions, contracts, issue history — have long tails. You need to know why a decision was made three years from now. External SaaS trackers lose that history when companies migrate tools, pivot pricing, or shut down. Keel issues are git commits: readable with `cat` in 20 years, diffable with `git log`, portable with `git clone`. The project's history is as durable as its code.

## Slash commands

After `keel init`, every project ships with `/pm-*` slash commands at
`.claude/commands/`. Type `/pm` in Claude Code to see them all at once.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/pm-scope <intent>` | Scope a new project from your intent and optional planning docs |
| `/pm-update <change>` | Apply a surgical change (status, comment, new node, session update) |
| `/pm-triage` | Process inbound suggestions, comments, and agent messages |
| `/pm-review <PR>` | Review a PR against the project repo for quality and completeness |
| `/pm-status` | PM-flavoured project summary with next-step recommendations |
| `/pm-graph` | Analyse the dependency graph: critical path, parallelizable work, cycles |
| `/pm-validate` | Run the validator, interpret errors, propose and apply fixes |
| `/pm-agenda` | Interpreted summary of everything in flight with recommendations |
| `/pm-plan` | Preview what init would produce, with interpretation |
| `/pm-handoff <issue>` | Create a session for an issue and hand off to a coding agent |
| `/pm-rescope <intent>` | Expand an existing project with new scope |
| `/pm-close <issue>` | Mark an issue done and write a closing comment |

Each slash command loads the project-manager skill, reads current state via
`keel brief`, then executes the relevant workflow.

## Commands

```text
keel init                     Bootstrap a project with templates + skills
keel next-key                 Atomic ID/key allocation (fcntl.flock)
keel validate                 14-check gate  (--strict, --fix, --format=json)
keel status                   Dashboard: issues, nodes, sessions, critical path
keel graph                    Render dependency or concept graph (mermaid/dot/json)

<summary><b>Why drift matters</b> — the problem this solves</summary>

You can't run a real software project on a stack of LLM agents yet, and the reason is drift.

- **Your issue tracker drifts from your code.** You write "the auth endpoint in the backend" today; six weeks later that endpoint moves and the issue text doesn't. The next agent builds against stale information.
- **Your context is scattered.** The issue is in Linear, the decision is in Notion, the API contract is in a Google Doc, the schema is in a Terraform module. An agent piecing those together burns half its tokens on reconciliation.
- **You can't run multiple coding agents in parallel without a coordinator.** Each needs a branch, an issue key, an awareness of who owns what. Without atomic key allocation, they stomp on each other.
- **Drift is a tax on every future invocation.** Mechanical search-and-replace across docs, issues, code, and schemas is exactly what LLMs are bad at. Partial reconciliations leave the next agent with more drift to chase.

`keel` fixes this by putting everything in one git repo with cross-referenced YAML, content-hashed concept nodes, and a 14-check validator that catches drift before the next agent reads it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Under the hood</b> — dual IDs, graph cache, freshness, orchestration</summary>

**Dual IDs.** Every entity has both a canonical `uuid4` (agent-generated, never changes) and a human key like `MP-42` (allocated atomically by `next-key` under `fcntl.flock`). Key collisions across branches are detected by the validator and resolved via the UUID, so references don't break.

**Concept graph with content hashing.** A concept node points at a region of a file in a repo:

```yaml
source:
  repo: myorg/backend
  path: src/api/routes/auth.py
  lines: [45, 82]
  branch: main
  content_hash: "sha256:e2c5a..."
```

`keel node check` fetches the current content (local clone preferred, `gh api` fallback) and compares SHA-256 hashes. Three outcomes: `FRESH`, `STALE`, `SOURCE_MISSING`. Stale nodes become validator errors.

**Graph cache.** `graph/index.yaml` is an incremental cache of all edges, rebuilt under `fcntl.flock`. `validate` calls `ensure_fresh` which picks between incremental update and full rebuild based on the current state.

**Auto-fix subset.** `validate --fix` repairs: missing timestamps (from file mtime), drifted `next_issue_number`, missing UUIDs, bidirectional `related` mismatches, label/list normalisation, basic ID collision renames. Everything else is on the agent.

**Orchestration patterns.** Declarative YAML rules for when humans approve, when the PM auto-acts, when sessions merge on pass:

```yaml
events:
  on_session_complete:
    - condition: "verification.passed"
      action: "merge_branch"
    - condition: "verification.failed"
      action: "request_human_review"
```

Per-project defaults in `orchestration/default.yaml`; per-session overrides in the session folder. The runtime that consumes them (see `docs/agent-containers.md`) is configured *by* the project repo, not the other way round.

**The PM skill.** `.claude/skills/project-manager/` ships into every `init` with 17 reference docs (workflows, schemas, validation codes, anti-patterns) and 13 canonical example files. When the agent is confused it reads the example. When the example is wrong the validator catches it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Worked example</b> — scoping from raw planning docs</summary>

1. `keel init my-project` creates the project with 73 templates, 43 skill files, 10 slash commands, 11 enums. Auto-derives the key prefix from the name (`my-project` → `MP`).
2. You open Claude Code in `my-project/` and type: `/pm-scope Build a knowledge base. Planning docs in ./plans/.`
3. The PM skill auto-loads. It calls `keel brief` to read project state, then reads `plans/*.md`.
4. The agent calls `keel next-key --type issue` 20 times, writes 20 issue YAML files into `issues/`, writes 15 concept nodes into `graph/nodes/`, writes 3 session folders into `sessions/`.
5. It runs `keel validate --strict --format=json`, parses the JSON, fixes any `ref/dangling`, `body/missing_heading`, or `status/unreachable` errors, re-runs.
6. Clean. The agent commits the result. You `keel status` and see a connected dependency graph with a critical path.

Everything is in git. Every reference resolves. Every concept node's content hash is current. The next agent that picks up a ticket has the full picture from one clone.

<details>
<summary><b>What we learned building this</b> — agent behaviour and workflow design</summary>

These insights come from running a real PM agent against an 8,000-line
planning corpus and watching what happened.

### Agents don't self-check unless forced

The agent produced 20 issues and declared done. When asked "what did
you miss?", it found 7 more issues and 4 missing concept nodes. The
capability was there — the workflow just never said "review your work."

Keel's scoping workflow now has a gap analysis step: after validation
passes, the agent rereads the planning docs and maps every deliverable
to an issue. Gaps become visible in a `scoping-verification.md`
artifact.

### Every workflow step must be load-bearing

If a step produces an artifact nothing reads, agents skip it. If step
N produces a file that step N+1 reads by name, skipping N breaks N+1.

The scoping plan is a file, not a mental sketch, because the next
step reads it. The compliance checklist is consumed by the commit
step. Every artifact earns its keep by being referenced downstream.

### Agents anchor, rationalize, and reason as if they were human

Agents don't experience time pressure or fatigue, but they produce
outputs that mirror those patterns — because their training data is
full of humans who do. The PM agent anchored on "15 issues" as a
target, compressed work into overstuffed issues, and said "with more
time I would split this." It doesn't lack time. It generates text
*as if* it does because that's what its training data looks like.

The same applies to rationalization: the agent hand-crafted UUIDs for
mental tracking, acknowledged the violation of its own rules, and
continued anyway — mimicking a human who knows the rule but judges
the shortcut acceptable.

The skill text overrides these learned patterns:
- "Do not set a target number before reading the docs"
- "You are not constrained by time. Split it now."
- "Write for the execution agent — it has not read the planning docs"

Red-flag tables (`| Agent thought | Reality |`) in each workflow
interrupt the pattern before the agent completes the rationalization
chain.

### Agent output degrades over time

In a 60-issue scoping run, the first 20 concrete issues averaged
2,470 characters and 4.0 node references. The last 20 averaged
1,883 characters and 1.5 references — a 24% drop in depth and 63%
drop in cross-referencing.

This mimics human cognitive fatigue from training data. The agent
generates text *as if* it were getting tired, because long working
sessions look that way in its training data.

The fix is structural, not motivational: a quality calibration
checkpoint every 20 issues forces the agent to compare its recent
output against its early output and rewrite if thinner. The
validator also detects the degradation pattern by comparing
first-third vs last-third of the issue set and flags inconsistency.

### Structure and semantics are different problems

`keel validate` checks structural integrity: schemas, references,
freshness. It does NOT check completeness — it can't know whether
you've covered every endpoint in the planning docs.

A clean validate is necessary but not sufficient. The gap analysis
step handles completeness. The PM skill says this explicitly so
agents don't treat the gate as proof of coverage.

### When in doubt, create the node

The original rule was "2+ issues or cross-repo." The agent applied
it conservatively and missed concepts referenced by 5+ issues.

The rule now: when in doubt, create it. The cost of an extra node
is 30 seconds. The cost of a missing node is undetected drift across
every issue that mentions the concept in prose.

### The project ships its own instruction set

`keel init` doesn't just create a data directory — it ships the PM
skill (33 files), 12 slash commands, and canonical examples. The
methodology is versioned in-tree with the project. Fork a project,
fork the methodology. Evolve it in a PR, review it like code.

Across every adjacent tool we studied (Linear, dbt, Terraform,
Obsidian, Fossil, superpowers, TDD), Keel is the only one that ships
methodology alongside state, versioned together.

## Status

**v0.2.** 502 tests pass. The validation gate is stable. The PM skill (33 reference files, 13 canonical examples) and 12 `/pm-*` slash commands ship into every initialised project. v0.2 added self-healing workflow loops, gap analysis, agent psychology defenses, JSON-first CLI defaults, and RFC 4122 UUID generation. APIs may change before v1.

**Not in v0:** web UI, managed cloud version, the agent execution runtime itself. Those are tracked in `docs/agent-containers.md` and `docs/keel-ui.md`.
