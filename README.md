> A git-native project tracker where the PM, coders, and verifier are AI agents.

Issues, architecture decisions, contracts, sessions — all YAML files in one
git repo, all cross-referenced, all validated by one 50 ms gate. Designed so
Claude Code (or any agent with file-write tools) can scope, track, and ship
real software projects without drifting from the code.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install keel
keel init my-project
cd my-project
claude
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/pm-scope Build a knowledge base with nodes and edges. Planning docs in ./planning/.
```

That's it. The agent reads your intent, scopes the project, writes the files,
validates its own work, and hands you a clean project to commit.

`keel init` auto-derives a key prefix from the project name (`my-project-cool` →
`MPC`), defaults to `main` as the base branch, and prompts for anything
non-obvious. Pass `--key-prefix`, `--base-branch`, or `--repos` to override.

## What it does

- **One repo, everything inside.** Issues, concept nodes, sessions, skills, templates, enums — all version-controlled in git. No external DB, no SaaS.
- **Dual ID system.** Canonical UUID + atomic human key (`MP-42`), allocated with `fcntl.flock`. Branch-merge safe.
- **Content-hashed concept graph.** `[[node-id]]` references point at file regions with SHA-256 hashes. Move code → one node updates → every downstream issue catches up. Drift is a validation error.
- **14-check validation gate.** Schema, references, bidirectional consistency, status transitions, freshness, sequence drift. JSON output. Auto-fix subset. ~50 ms on a typical project. Rebuilds the graph cache as a side effect.
- **One-shot context brief.** `keel brief` gives an agent config, enums, templates, skill examples, next IDs, and the validation loop in a single tool-call result. The PM skill calls it automatically — you never have to.
- **Customisable session artifacts.** Plans, task checklists, verification checklists, testing plans, post-completion comments — per-project manifest, enforced by the validator.
- **Progressive-disclosure PM skill.** 33 reference files and canonical examples ship into every `init`. The agent reads the example, not the schema doc.

## Demo

```text
$ keel validate --strict --format=json
{
  "exit_code": 0,
  "errors": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "fixed": [],
  "cache_rebuilt": true,
  "duration_ms": 47
}

$ keel status
my-project (MP)
  Issues: 23  (backlog=12, todo=8, in_progress=3)
  Concept nodes: 17 active, 2 stale
  Sessions: 4  (2 completed, 1 in_progress, 1 waiting_for_review)
  Critical path: MP-1 → MP-7 → MP-12 → MP-18  (length 4)
```

## How it works

Four principles. Each one is a deliberate choice.

**1. The project repo is the single source of truth.** Nothing lives in Linear, Notion, or a Google Doc. Clone the repo and you have the whole project.

**2. Agents are the primary users.** The CLI is intentionally minimal — read, validate, atomic ID allocation. Agents create issues and nodes by writing files directly with their `Write` tool, then run the validator.

**3. The concept graph is coherence.** Instead of prose like "the auth endpoint," issues reference `[[auth-token-endpoint]]` — a node file pointing at a specific file and line range with a stored content hash. When the code moves, one file updates. Stale hashes surface as validator errors.

**4. Validation is the gate.** Every agent loop ends with `keel validate --strict --format=json`. The same command rebuilds the graph cache incrementally. The loop is: write files → validate → fix → validate → commit.

**Why in-repo.** Project artifacts — decisions, contracts, issue history — have long tails. You need to know why a decision was made three years from now. External SaaS trackers lose that history when companies migrate tools, pivot pricing, or shut down. Keel issues are git commits: readable with `cat` in 20 years, diffable with `git log`, portable with `git clone`. The project's history is as durable as its code.

## Slash commands

After `keel init`, every project ships with `/pm-*` slash commands at
`.claude/commands/`. Type `/pm` in Claude Code to see them all at once.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/pm-scope <intent>` | Scope a new project from your intent and optional planning docs |
| `/pm-update <change>` | Apply a surgical change (status, comment, new node, session update) |
| `/pm-triage` | Process inbound suggestions, comments, and agent messages |
| `/pm-review <PR>` | Review a PR against the project repo for quality and completeness |
| `/pm-status` | PM-flavoured project summary with next-step recommendations |
| `/pm-graph` | Analyse the dependency graph: critical path, parallelizable work, cycles |
| `/pm-validate` | Run the validator, interpret errors, propose and apply fixes |
| `/pm-agenda` | Interpreted summary of everything in flight with recommendations |
| `/pm-plan` | Preview what init would produce, with interpretation |
| `/pm-handoff <issue>` | Create a session for an issue and hand off to a coding agent |
| `/pm-rescope <intent>` | Expand an existing project with new scope |
| `/pm-close <issue>` | Mark an issue done and write a closing comment |

Each slash command loads the project-manager skill, reads current state via
`keel brief`, then executes the relevant workflow.

<summary><b>Why drift matters</b> — the problem this solves</summary>

You can't run a real software project on a stack of LLM agents yet, and the reason is drift.

- **Your issue tracker drifts from your code.** You write "the auth endpoint in the backend" today; six weeks later that endpoint moves and the issue text doesn't. The next agent builds against stale information.
- **Your context is scattered.** The issue is in Linear, the decision is in Notion, the API contract is in a Google Doc, the schema is in a Terraform module. An agent piecing those together burns half its tokens on reconciliation.
- **You can't run multiple coding agents in parallel without a coordinator.** Each needs a branch, an issue key, an awareness of who owns what. Without atomic key allocation, they stomp on each other.
- **Drift is a tax on every future invocation.** Mechanical search-and-replace across docs, issues, code, and schemas is exactly what LLMs are bad at. Partial reconciliations leave the next agent with more drift to chase.

`keel` fixes this by putting everything in one git repo with cross-referenced YAML, content-hashed concept nodes, and a 14-check validator that catches drift before the next agent reads it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Under the hood</b> — dual IDs, graph cache, freshness, orchestration</summary>

**Dual IDs.** Every entity has both a canonical `uuid4` (agent-generated, never changes) and a human key like `MP-42` (allocated atomically by `next-key` under `fcntl.flock`). Key collisions across branches are detected by the validator and resolved via the UUID, so references don't break.

**Concept graph with content hashing.** A concept node points at a region of a file in a repo:

```yaml
source:
  repo: myorg/backend
  path: src/api/routes/auth.py
  lines: [45, 82]
  branch: main
  content_hash: "sha256:e2c5a..."
```

`keel node check` fetches the current content (local clone preferred, `gh api` fallback) and compares SHA-256 hashes. Three outcomes: `FRESH`, `STALE`, `SOURCE_MISSING`. Stale nodes become validator errors.

**Graph cache.** `graph/index.yaml` is an incremental cache of all edges, rebuilt under `fcntl.flock`. `validate` calls `ensure_fresh` which picks between incremental update and full rebuild based on the current state.

**Auto-fix subset.** `validate --fix` repairs: missing timestamps (from file mtime), drifted `next_issue_number`, missing UUIDs, bidirectional `related` mismatches, label/list normalisation, basic ID collision renames. Everything else is on the agent.

**Orchestration patterns.** Declarative YAML rules for when humans approve, when the PM auto-acts, when sessions merge on pass:

```yaml
events:
  on_session_complete:
    - condition: "verification.passed"
      action: "merge_branch"
    - condition: "verification.failed"
      action: "request_human_review"
```

Per-project defaults in `orchestration/default.yaml`; per-session overrides in the session folder. The runtime that consumes them (see `docs/agent-containers.md`) is configured *by* the project repo, not the other way round.

**The PM skill.** `.claude/skills/project-manager/` ships into every `init` with 17 reference docs (workflows, schemas, validation codes, anti-patterns) and 13 canonical example files. When the agent is confused it reads the example. When the example is wrong the validator catches it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Worked example</b> — scoping from raw planning docs</summary>

1. `keel init my-project` creates the project with 73 templates, 43 skill files, 10 slash commands, 11 enums. Auto-derives the key prefix from the name (`my-project` → `MP`).
2. You open Claude Code in `my-project/` and type: `/pm-scope Build a knowledge base. Planning docs in ./raw_planning/.`
3. The PM skill auto-loads. It calls `keel brief` to read project state, then reads `raw_planning/*.md`.
4. The agent calls `keel next-key --type issue` 20 times, writes 20 issue YAML files into `issues/`, writes 15 concept nodes into `graph/nodes/`, writes 3 session folders into `sessions/`.
5. It runs `keel validate --strict --format=json`, parses the JSON, fixes any `ref/dangling`, `body/missing_heading`, or `status/unreachable` errors, re-runs.
6. Clean. The agent commits the result. You `keel status` and see a connected dependency graph with a critical path.

Everything is in git. Every reference resolves. Every concept node's content hash is current. The next agent that picks up a ticket has the full picture from one clone.

## Status

**v0.** 448 tests pass. The validation gate is stable. The PM skill and 10 `/pm-*` slash commands ship into every initialised project. APIs may change before v1.

**Not in v0:** web UI, managed cloud version, the agent execution runtime itself. Those are tracked in `docs/agent-containers.md` and `docs/keel-ui.md`.
