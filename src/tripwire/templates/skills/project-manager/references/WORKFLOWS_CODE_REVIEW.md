# Workflow: Code Review

Closes a coding session. The session produces a **PR pair** —
`tripwire-pr` (project tracking repo) and `project-pr` (code repo).
Both must land atomically; either alone leaves the project graph
and shipped code out of sync. v0.9 splits this cycle out of
`coding-session` so each station has its own controls and audit.

## Trigger

`pm-monitor` fires `signal.session_pr_pair_open` when both PR URLs
are set on `session.yaml` and both PRs are in
`{open, ready_for_review}`; dispatch routes to
`code-review.received` (see `MONITOR_CRITERIA.md`).

## Stations

### `received`
Confirm the PR pair is present and live. Tripwires
`v_pr_pair_present`, `v_branch_alive`. Records PR URLs, branches,
head SHAs (pinning so downstream stations measure against the
review's starting commit).

### `gate-check`
1. `gh pr checkout <project-pr>`.
2. `tripwire validate` against the tripwire-pr branch.
3. Walk the verification checklist
   (`templates/skills/verification/`).
4. `tripwire session review <id> --write-verified` → emits
   `docs/issues/<KEY>/verified.md` per closed issue.

`--write-verified` runs here because once branches merge or delete,
the per-issue evidence (diff ranges, test outputs, AC walk) cannot
be reconstructed. Tripwires `v_validate_passes_on_branch`,
`v_verified_md_written` — failing either halts before reviewers
are dispatched.

### `independent-reviews`
Three parallel reads:

1. **Self-review.** PM reads the agent's four-lens self-review on
   the project-pr.
2. **Superpowers subagent.** PM dispatches per
   `superpowers-code-review.md`. Output:
   `<project>/sessions/<id>/reviews/superpowers.yaml`.
   Implementation lives outside this repo; tripwire only consumes
   the file.
3. **Codex.** PM comments `@codex` on the project-pr. Findings
   surface as PR comments; PM extracts to
   `<project>/sessions/<id>/reviews/codex.md`.

If a reviewer doesn't return, the PM proceeds and records the
absence in synthesis.

### `synthesis`
PM reads all three reviews end-to-end and writes
`<project>/sessions/<id>/reviews/synthesis.md`: one row per finding
(severity, source, PM verdict accept / reject / defer), final
overall verdict (`merge` | `relaunch`).

Decision rule of thumb:

- Any **blocking** finding not rejected with written rationale →
  relaunch.
- Any **major** finding outside `session.repo_paths` → relaunch.
- Self + superpowers clean, codex only nits → merge.
- Reviewers disagree on a major finding → PM is tiebreaker;
  rationale recorded in synthesis.

Controls:

- JIT prompt `reviews-not-actually-read` (hidden, ack-required;
  aspirational id, stage 2 implements the ack). Forces the PM to
  confirm they actually read all three reviews.
- Heuristic `scope-creep-detected` (aspirational; hidden in stage
  2). Fires when project-pr touches paths outside
  `session.repo_paths`.
- Prompt-checks on outgoing routes: `pm-review` for the merge
  branch; `pm-session-reopen` for the relaunch branch.

### `node-reconcile`
Identify nodes the project-pr touches (via divergence callouts and
`verified.md`). For each: body diverges → update (shipped wins;
see `WORKFLOWS_NODE_RECONCILIATION.md`); concept with no node → create
it; source changed → rehash `source.content_hash`.

Cross-link: `node-reconcile → concept-freshness.detected,
kind: triggers`. Reconciling before merge keeps the drift scoped
to the session that caused it.

### `merge` — terminal pass-state
Merge tripwire-pr, merge project-pr, emit `merge` event. Tripwires
`v_no_stale_nodes_post_reconcile` (guards "PM said merge but
freshness scan still has open items"),
`v_done_implies_issue_artifacts_on_main` (guards "session done but
verified.md / closing comment never landed on main").

### `relaunch` — terminal fail-state
1. Write `sessions/<id>/pm-followup.md` keyed to findings (one
   bullet each: severity, suggested fix).
2. `tripwire session reopen <id> --reason "<one-line summary>"`.
3. `tripwire session spawn <id> --resume`.

Cross-link: `relaunch → coding-session.executing, kind: triggers`.
The resumed session reads `pm-followup.md` plus `plan.md`'s
`## PM follow-up` section, addresses each finding, pushes to the
existing PR pair, and posts a per-finding summary comment. When
`session complete` runs again, `pm-monitor` re-fires the trigger
and `code-review` runs from `received` — every iteration is
attributable.

## @codex trigger

PM comments `@codex` on the **project-pr** (not the tripwire-pr).
Codex listens on the code repo and surfaces findings as PR
comments. No structured contract — codex writes prose; PM extracts
to `codex.md`.

## Audit

Every station entry/exit appends to
`<project>/orchestration/monitor-log.yaml`. The synthesis verdict
is the load-bearing entry — it explains why the session merged or
relaunched.
