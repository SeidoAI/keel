# Workflow: Triage

Processing inbound suggestions — comments on existing issues, messages
from coding agents, bug reports, or new requests — into actionable
project changes. This is the "someone said something, now what?" flow.

## Sources of inbound

- **Comments on issues** — humans or agents adding notes to
  `issues/<KEY>/comments/`
- **Agent messages** — blocking or informational messages from a
  coding agent (`question`, `stuck`, `escalation`, `fyi`)
- **Post-completion comments** — a completed session's
  `post-completion-comments.md` listing suggested follow-ups
- **Bug reports** — external bug reports landing in an inbox

## Procedure

### 1. Read the inbound item in full
Don't skim. If it's a comment thread, read every comment. If it's an
agent message, read the priority and body carefully.

### 2. Classify

- **Actionable now** → new issue
- **Needs more info** → respond with a question comment or message
- **Duplicate** → comment on the existing issue linking the duplicate
- **Won't do** → comment with rationale, mark any related session or
  epic as unaffected
- **Epic / strategic** → defer to human planning; write a summary
  comment but don't create issues

### 3. For "actionable now" items
Follow `WORKFLOWS_INCREMENTAL_UPDATE.md` to create a new issue.

Capture:
- **Context** — what prompted this item
- **Requirements** — concrete acceptance criteria, not vague goals
- **Dependencies** — what needs to be in place first
- **Concept nodes** — does this touch an existing node? Create
  `[[references]]` in the body so the graph stays connected

Use `next-key` for the issue key. Reference any existing nodes from the
body. If this introduces a new concept (new endpoint, new model, new
decision), create the node file too.

### 4. For "needs more info" items
Add a `question` comment to the relevant issue (or respond to the agent
message). Use `examples/comment-status-change.yaml` as a starting point
but change `type: status_change` to `type: question`.

Your question should:
- Reference the inbound item by quote or comment id
- Be specific about what information you need
- Suggest options when possible

### 5. For duplicates / won't-dos
Add a comment to the existing issue. Mark the inbound item as processed
(update its status in the source, if applicable).

### 6. Validate and commit
```bash
keel validate --strict
```
Every new issue, every new comment, every new node must pass the gate.

## Red flags — triage-specific rationalizations

| Agent thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This inbound is low-priority, I'll ignore it" | You don't ignore inbounds. Create a comment on the relevant issue acknowledging it, even if you defer the work. |
| "I'll create the issue now and figure out the scope later" | Triage means decide scope *now*. A scopeless issue is PM debt. |
