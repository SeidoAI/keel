# Workflow: Concept-Freshness / Node Reconciliation

Concept nodes pin a `source` (repo, path, branch, content_hash) so
the graph ages cleanly against a moving source repo. This workflow
closes the loop: stale nodes get walked and resolved as refreshed,
accepted, or deleted.

`concept-freshness` in `workflow.yaml` runs `detected → reviewing →
reconciled`. Triggered by `signal.stale_node_count_high`;
`code-review.node-reconcile` cross-links into `detected` too.

## When it fires

1. **`signal.stale_node_count_high`** from `pm-monitor` — count of
   `v_freshness` failures crosses `monitor.stale_node_count_high`
   (default 5). Dispatch → `concept-freshness.detected`. See
   `MONITOR_CRITERIA.md`.
2. **`code-review.node-reconcile → detected`** — after a session
   merges, the touched-source rehash usually refreshes a few hashes;
   the cross-link kicks a project-wide scan while the PM is already
   in reconciliation context. See `WORKFLOWS_CODE_REVIEW.md`.

PM-driven. Subagent dispatch allowed; default is inline (judgment
calls benefit from full context).

## Walking the queue (`reviewing`)

```bash
tripwire validate --json | jq '.errors[] | select(.code == "v_freshness")'
```

For each result: read the node file (`nodes/<id>.yaml`) and the
current `source.path` content. Decide in order:

1. **Refresh** — source moved, body still right. Default.
2. **Accept divergence** — source moved, body intentionally describes
   the older / aspirational design.
3. **Delete** — source gone, concept obsolete.

**Example.** `file-watcher.yaml` points at `watcher.py`,
`content_hash: sha256:abc…`. Current SHA is `def…`. Body mentions a
100ms debounce; current code debounces at 250ms with a burst
coalescer. This is a **refresh**: body updated, hash bumped to `def…`.

## Refresh

```bash
sha256sum src/tripwire/_internal/watcher.py
```

Edit the node file: update affected body sections, set
`source.content_hash` to the new SHA, update `source.branch` if it
moved, bump `updated_at`. Re-validate — `v_freshness` clears.

## Accept divergence

Rare. The body intentionally describes an older contract (because
the rest of the graph references it that way) or an aspirational
design the source hasn't caught up to.

Append a `## Divergence` body section naming what changed and why it
wasn't rewritten:

```markdown
## Divergence

As of 2026-05-04 `watcher.py` debounces at 250ms, not 100ms. 100ms
is preserved here because [[websocket-hub]] and [[event-emitter]]
reference it as the contract; tracked in SEI-87.
```

Update `source.content_hash` anyway — accepting still means
re-pinning, or the next scan re-fires.

## Delete

1. `rm nodes/<id>.yaml`.
2. `tripwire refs reverse <id>` — find every node whose `related:`
   includes the deleted id.
3. Edit each to drop the id (graph stays bidirectional).
4. Validate.

If reverse-refs is non-trivial, prefer accept-divergence — deletion
cascades are easy to get wrong.

## Bidirectional `related:`

`a.related ⊇ {b}` ⟺ `b.related ⊇ {a}`. Validator warns
(`w_related_asymmetric`) on asymmetric edges; reconciliation is when
to clean them up. When a refresh adds a new related concept, update
both sides.

## Reaching `reconciled`

Exit conditions: every entry-time `v_freshness` failure handled (refresh
/ accept / delete); `tripwire validate` reports zero `v_freshness`;
reverse-ref cleanup committed.

Commit: `reconcile: <node-list> after freshness scan` (or
`after #<pr>` when triggered by a merge). See `COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md`.
