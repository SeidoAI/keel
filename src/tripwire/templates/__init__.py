"""Packaged default templates.

This is the tree that `keel init` copies into a new project. After
init, the project owns the copied templates — the package is no longer
canonical for them. Projects can add, remove, or reshape templates freely.

Call `get_templates_dir()` to locate the templates at runtime, regardless
of whether the package is installed editable or from a wheel.
