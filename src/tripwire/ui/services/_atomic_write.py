"""Atomic file writes for mutation services.

All new-file writes in ``tripwire.ui.services`` (approval sidecars,
audit log entries) route through these helpers so the file watcher
cannot observe a half-written file. The two service-owned entity
writes — ``project.yaml`` in :mod:`~tripwire.ui.services.action_service`
and ``session.yaml`` in the same module — also use these helpers via
local ``_atomic_save_*`` wrappers that mirror the core
``save_project`` / ``save_session`` serialisation. Issue writes still
go through :func:`tripwire.core.store.save_issue` per the KUI-24
execution constraint; that helper does a direct ``path.write_text``
and is not yet atomic.

The mechanism is the classic ``write-to-temp → os.replace`` pattern:
``os.replace`` is guaranteed atomic on POSIX and on NTFS (since Python
3.3), so a concurrent reader either sees the old file or the complete
new one — never a torn payload.

The temp file is created in the same directory as the destination so
``os.replace`` is a same-filesystem rename (an atomic inode flip) rather
than a cross-device copy.
