"""Transition-token runtime — the workflow gate runner (KUI-159).

A transition is a request to move a session from its current station
to a target station. The runtime:

1. Loads ``<project>/workflow.yaml``, finds the workflow the session
   belongs to (``coding-session`` for v0.9; future workflows look up
   by ``trigger:`` against the spawn event).
2. Verifies the target station is reachable from the current station
   (single-id ``next:`` matches, or one of the conditional branches
   resolves to it).
3. Runs the gate:

   a. **Validators** — call :func:`tripwire.core.validator.validate_project`
      with ``strict=True``. Any error fails the gate. This is the
      same code path the KUI-110 edit-time hook drives (no parallel
      hook surface).
   b. **Tripwires** — for every tripwire registered at the target
      station (``at = (workflow, station)``), confirm
      :meth:`Tripwire.is_acknowledged` returns True. An unack'd
      blocking tripwire fails the gate.
   c. **Prompt-checks** — for every prompt-check declared at the
      *current* station, query the events log to verify it was
      invoked since the session entered the current station. Missing
      ones fail the gate. (Verifies the PM ran the required check
      before the agent transitioned away.)

4. On pass: session.status = target, ``current_station_instance``
   bumped, ``transition.completed`` emitted.
5. On fail: ``transition.rejected`` emitted with a structured
   ``reason``; session stays put.

Concurrency: per-session lockfile under
``.tripwire/locks/transition-<sid>.lock`` serialises concurrent
transitions on the same session.
