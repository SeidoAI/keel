Four-primitive control model (locked):

- ``tripwire`` — hard pass/fail gate; blocks until file/state passes
- ``heuristic`` — soft warn-once detector; does not block
- ``jit_prompt`` — hidden ack-required prompt
- ``prompt_check`` — required slash-command invocation

Conditional predicates are equality-only for v0.9 (locked decision in
``backlog-architecture.md``): ``<dot-path> (==|!=) <bare-value>``.

The schema lives here as plain dataclasses (not Pydantic) — the loader
parses the raw YAML into these structures so we control coercion and
error messages directly. Pydantic was considered but the file shape
involves three distinct ``next:`` shapes that are awkward to express
as a discriminated-union BaseModel; the dataclass tree keeps the
runtime contract readable.
