"""Workflow drift detection (KUI-124).

Drift is the gap between the workflow.yaml-declared lifecycle and what
the events log records actually happened. Four classes of drift:

- ``drift/prompt_check_missing`` — a target status declared
  ``prompt_checks: [...]`` but the session entered that status without a
  ``prompt_check.invoked`` event for one of the declared ids.
- ``drift/jit_prompt_should_have_fired`` — a target status declared
  ``jit_prompts: [...]`` but the session entered it without a
  ``jit_prompt.fired`` event for one of them. Either the JIT prompt is
  miswired or the gate runner skipped it.
- ``drift/heuristic_should_have_fired`` — a target status declared
  ``heuristics: [...]`` but the session entered it without any
  ``heuristic.fired`` event for those ids in the stay window. Severity
  is ``warning`` (not ``error``) — heuristics are advisory by design,
  so the absence is a softer signal than a missed jit_prompt.
- ``drift/unexpected_transition`` — session.yaml currently sits at a
  status that's NOT reachable from the last
  ``transition.completed.to_status``. Means somebody (or some tool)
  flipped session.status directly without going through
  ``tripwire transition``.

Surfaced via :func:`detect_drift` (returns
:class:`DriftFinding` list) and the ``tripwire drift report`` CLI.

The reader walks the events log chronologically and checks each
``transition.completed`` row against the target status entry gate
declared in ``workflow.yaml``.
