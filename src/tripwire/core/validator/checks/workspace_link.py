"""Bidirectional workspace<->project link consistency check.

Tripwire workspaces and projects link two ways:

  * project side: ``project.yaml.workspace.path`` points at the
    workspace dir.
  * workspace side: ``workspace.yaml.projects[]`` lists the projects
    registered with the workspace.

This check enforces both halves agree. Drift (a project pointing at
a workspace that doesn't list it back, or vice versa) means a stale
config that the UI will silently mis-bucket. Catching it here keeps
the link a single source of truth.

Severity: ``error``. The fix is mechanical (``tripwire workspace
link``), so a hard error is the right level — silent warnings let
the inconsistency rot.
