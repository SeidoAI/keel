"""KUI-145 (D3) — concept name appears as prose without ``[[node-id]]``.

Heuristic: when the human-readable name of a concept node appears in
≥N (default 2) issue bodies AS PROSE (case-folded substring match),
without those issues using a proper ``[[node-id]]`` reference, the
project is drifting back toward "names as identifiers". The lint
warns rather than errors — the heuristic has false positives and the
fix is a one-line edit.

Threshold ``min_issues`` is read from
:mod:`tripwire.core.validator.lint._thresholds` (overrideable via
``project.yaml.lint_config.concept_name_prose.min_issues`` in D7).
