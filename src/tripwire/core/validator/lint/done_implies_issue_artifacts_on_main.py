"""Issues at ``status: done`` must have their required artifacts on origin/main.

The correctness contract for issues. Every required file listed in
``project.yaml.artifact_manifest.issue_required`` (defaults to
``developer.md`` and ``verified.md``) must be present on the merged-
main snapshot of the project tracking repo (``origin/main``); "on
main" is the only state that counts.

Online-first. We don't ``git fetch`` from inside validate (would hit
the network on every run). If ``origin/main`` is unreadable (no remote,
no fetch yet, repo isn't a git checkout), emit a single
``done_implies_artifacts/main_unavailable`` warning and skip the
per-issue checks — the operator can re-run after a fetch.

The session half of this rule (which gated on the deleted
``legacy_completed`` status and checked the pre-v0.8 flat artifact
layout) was removed in KUI-158. The modern session check is
``check_artifact_presence`` in ``validator/__init__.py``.
