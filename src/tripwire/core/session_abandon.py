"""Session abandon orchestration (v0.7.9 §A4).

`abandoned` is the terminal status that does NOT claim success. It's
the answer to "this session can't legitimately reach `done`, but I
need to stop pretending it's still in flight." The framework's two
terminal states are `done` (passed every gate) and `abandoned`
(stopped, didn't pass). There is no third "done with caveats" state
on purpose — that's what spec §A4 is rejecting.

Behaviour:
- Kill the runtime handle if the session is still executing.
- Close any OPEN PRs for the session's branches via ``gh pr close``.
  Merged PRs are left alone (closing a merged PR makes no sense).
- Remove every worktree the session created.
- Transition the session to ``abandoned``.
- Issues are NOT closed as ``done``. They stay where they are; the
  PM moves them to ``backlog`` / ``canceled`` / ``won't-do`` per case.

The runtime tear-down is best-effort. If any step fails, we record
the failure in the result and proceed with the rest — abandoning is
about state cleanup, and a failure in one step shouldn't block the
others. The session ALWAYS transitions to ``abandoned``; that's the
contract.
