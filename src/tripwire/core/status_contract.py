"""Issue ↔ session status contract (v0.9.4).

Single source of truth for the relationship between session statuses and
the set of issue statuses allowed for member issues at each session phase.

Background
----------

Pre-v0.9.4 the two enums (``IssueStatus``, ``SessionStatus``) drifted with
no machine-checked relationship between them. Three concepts pair across
the enums (``backlog`` ≡ ``planned``, ``todo`` ≡ ``queued``,
``in_progress`` ≡ ``executing``, ``done`` ≡ ``completed``,
``canceled`` ≡ ``abandoned``); v0.9.4 collapses these onto one canonical
name per concept and adds an ``ALLOWED_ISSUE_STATES_BY_SESSION_STATE``
contract a sweep helper can drive against.

Read-aliases preserve back-compat: pre-v0.9.4 PT data with the old names
loads cleanly via ``normalize_issue_status`` / ``normalize_session_status``.
Aliases are dropped in v1.0.

Public surface
--------------

* ``ISSUE_ALIASES``, ``SESSION_ALIASES`` — old → canonical name maps.
* ``normalize_issue_status``, ``normalize_session_status`` — apply aliases.
* ``ALLOWED_ISSUE_STATES_BY_SESSION_STATE`` — the contract table.
* ``is_issue_state_compatible_with_session_state(s, i)`` — invariant check.
* ``sweep_target_for(session_state)`` — what state member issues should
  reach when the session enters ``session_state`` (None = no sweep).
* ``sweep_issues(project_dir, session, target_session_state)`` — apply the
  sweep to every member issue, returning the list of issue keys whose
  status changed.

# --- The contract: issue states ⊆ allowed-by-session-state -------------------

# Each session state pins a range of allowed issue states for member
# issues. ``deferred`` and ``abandoned`` are always allowed:
#  * ``deferred`` — consciously-skipped issues carry forward unchanged
#    through every session phase (e.g. punted within a session).
#  * ``abandoned`` — the project.yaml transition table allows
#    `* → abandoned` from any active state, mirroring the user-facing
#    ability to drop an issue at any time. The contract must agree, or
#    `check_issue_session_status_compatibility` would falsely error
#    every time a session-member issue is abandoned mid-flight.
#
# v0.9.4 (codex round-4 P1 #2): ``verified`` session rollback to
# ``in_review`` is a documented session lifecycle path. The
# rolled-back session keeps its already-verified issues; sweep is
# forward-only so they stay at ``verified``. The contract for the
# ``in_review`` session state therefore admits ``verified`` issues
# (the rollback case) in addition to ``in_review`` ones.
#
# An issue's status must be in the set keyed by its session's status.
# Validators enforce this on write; ``sweep_issues`` advances issues to
# the floor when a session transitions forward.
