"""Drift report — single coherence score (KUI-128 / A3).

Aggregates the project's existing drift signals into one 0-100
score. Higher is healthier. The signals are:

- ``stale_pins`` — pinned references whose target has had a
  PM-marked contract change. Heavy weight.
- ``unresolved_refs`` — `[[id]]` references that don't resolve to
  any known entity. Heavy weight.
- ``stale_concepts`` — concept nodes whose `source.content_hash`
  no longer matches the file on disk. Medium weight.
- ``workflow_drift_findings`` — active mismatches between declared
  ``workflow.yaml`` stations and the canonical v0.9 workflow event log.
  Medium weight. Reads ``events/*.jsonl`` via the KUI-123 substrate.

Weights are starting values, calibrated by inspection rather than a
data-driven study. ``decisions.md`` documents this; the PM can
recalibrate against the v0 PT corpus by adjusting :data:`WEIGHTS`.
