"""Post-PR auto-check watcher (v0.7.9 §A8).

Polls open PRs across active sessions and emits :class:`WatcherAction`
records when one of three tripwires fires:

  #15      code PR open + matching PT PR doesn't exist after 10 min
  #17      PR merged but ``session.status`` is still ``executing``
  #18-19   PT PR opens but the diff doesn't include all required artifacts

Designed as a pure-function over its inputs: the caller injects
``fetch_pr`` and ``fetch_pr_files`` callables so tests supply canned
GitHub responses, and the watcher returns ``WatcherAction`` records
the executor turns into side effects (plan-md follow-up, status
writeback, GH issue comment, agent re-engagement).

The runtime daemon (``tripwire watch start``) builds the
:class:`WatchedSession` list each tick from the live session-store,
calls :meth:`PRWatcher.tick`, and dispatches the actions.
