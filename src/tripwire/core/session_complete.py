"""Session complete orchestration.

Gates session close-out behind: (a) session in a completable status,
(b) every worktree branch has a merged PR, (c) every required issue
artifact present, (d) most recent review exit_code ≤ 1. Then closes
issues, transitions the session to `completed`, and removes worktrees.

v0.7.9 §A4: every gate is mandatory. There are no bypass flags. A
session that can't pass these gates should be `tripwire session
abandon`-ed, which is a terminal status that does not claim success.

Insights application is out-of-scope here — the PM's
`/pm-session-complete` runs `tripwire session insights apply/reject`
before invoking this routine.
