"""Three-way merge engine for workspace-origin nodes.

Compares base (workspace at last_pulled_sha), ours (current project
copy), and theirs (current workspace HEAD). Returns a MergeResult
with a status and either a merged dict (trivial cases) or a
conflicting_fields list (non-trivial — handled by merge brief).

Bookkeeping fields (``uuid``, ``created_at``, ``updated_at``,
``origin``, ``scope``, ``workspace_sha``, ``workspace_pulled_at``)
are excluded from the merge diff — they describe the *pull*, not the
node's content.
