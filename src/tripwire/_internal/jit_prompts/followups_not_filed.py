"""Followups-not-filed JIT prompt — KUI-139 / B5.

Fires on ``session.complete`` when a session's ``pm-response.yaml``
declares ``decision: deferred`` items with ``follow_up: KUI-XXX`` but
the referenced issues don't exist on disk. Enforces the standing
project rule "Follow-ups are immediate, not deferred" — a deferred
decision must be paired with an actually-filed issue, not a paper
promise.

Silently no-ops when the pm-response.yaml doesn't exist yet (the PM
hasn't responded), so the first session.complete invocation doesn't
spuriously fire.

Your `pm-response.yaml` declared at least one `decision: deferred`

disk. The project's standing rule is "Follow-ups are immediate, not
deferred" — a deferred decision must be paired with an actually-filed
issue, not a paper promise.

For each declared follow-up:

  1. Run `tripwire next-key` to get a fresh issue key (don't reuse
     the placeholder).
  2. Author `issues/<KEY>/issue.yaml` with the smallest reasonable
     scope you'd accept on the next session.
  3. Update the `pm-response.yaml` item's `follow_up:` to point at
     the real key if you allocated a new one.

Re-run with `--ack`. The marker requires fix-commit SHAs OR
`declared_no_findings: true`.

Stop. The PM response defers items with `follow_up: KUI-XXX` but the
referenced issues aren't filed. Deferral without filing is the
shape of a TODO that never lands.

Walk every `decision: deferred` item in `pm-response.yaml`. For each
one whose `follow_up:` value doesn't resolve to a real
`issues/<KEY>/issue.yaml`:

  - File the issue now (or pick an existing key) with a real scope,
    not a placeholder body.
  - Re-run with `--ack` once the marker carries fix-commit SHAs OR
    `declared_no_findings: true` (the latter only after the
    pm-response is corrected to remove the spurious follow_up).

    """\
Deferred items in `pm-response.yaml` are a contract: the work moves,
but it stays visible as a real issue with a real key. Right now,
that contract is broken — at least one `follow_up: <KEY>` reference
points at nothing.

Two ways forward:

  Path A — File the missing issues. For each unfiled `follow_up`,
  create the `issues/<KEY>/issue.yaml` with a scope you'd actually
  hand to a future session.
  Path B — Convert the deferral. If the deferral was wrong, change
  the `decision:` value in `pm-response.yaml` to `accepted` /
  `rejected` / `re-engaged` and remove the `follow_up:` field.

Either way, re-run with `--ack`. The marker is rejected if it lacks
fix-commit SHAs and does not declare `declared_no_findings: true`.
