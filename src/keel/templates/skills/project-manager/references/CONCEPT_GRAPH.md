# Concept Graph

The concept graph is the mechanism that keeps issues, code, contracts,
and decisions coherent as a project evolves. It's the single most
important design element in this system — more important than the issue
schema or the validation gate.

## The problem it solves

Without a concept graph, three things drift independently:

1. The issue text (written once, stale forever)
2. The actual code (changes via PRs)
3. The doc or contract the issue referenced (changes separately)

Nobody notices until a downstream agent picks up a later issue and
builds against stale information. Agents compound the damage because
they can't tell which source is authoritative. **Drift is a tax on
every future agent invocation.**

## The solution

A **concept node** is a named, versioned pointer to a concrete artifact
in the codebase. Instead of prose like "the auth endpoint in the
backend", issues reference `[[auth-token-endpoint]]` — a stable
identifier that resolves to a specific file, line range, and content
hash.

## When to create a node

**Create a node when a concept is referenced by multiple issues OR
crosses a repo boundary.**

That's the rule. Named bookmarks into the codebase. One-off file
mentions in a single issue stay as inline prose.

Good candidates for nodes:
- API endpoints that downstream issues consume
- Data models used across multiple features
- Decisions (DEC-xxx) that constrain multiple issues
- API contracts implementing a specification
- Environment variables or config values consumed in multiple places
- Terraform outputs consumed by other repos

Bad candidates (keep as prose):
- A single helper function only mentioned once
- Local variables
- Things that don't exist yet and are unlikely to be referenced
  (exception: `status: planned` nodes for upcoming work are fine if
  you already know 2+ issues will reference them)

## Reference syntax

`[[node-id]]` in any Markdown body (issue, node description, comment)
parses as a reference. The reference parser:

- Matches lowercase, letter-first, hyphenated slugs
- Skips fenced code blocks (`` ``` `` and `~~~`)
- Deduplicates within a file but preserves document order

Examples:
- ✓ `Uses the [[user-model]] for lookups.`
- ✓ `See [[dec-003-session-tokens]] for the rationale.`
- ✗ `[[UserModel]]` — uppercase not allowed
- ✗ `[[user_model]]` — underscores not allowed
- ✗ `Inside a ``` code block ``` [[ref]]` — skipped by the parser

## The graph cache

`graph/index.yaml` is a committed cache of the concept graph built from
scanning every issue and node file. Its purpose is to make graph reads
O(1) without rescanning everything.

The validator rebuilds the cache as a side effect. You never edit it
by hand — delete it and run `validate` if you think it's corrupt.

## Freshness

Every active node with a `source` has a `content_hash`. During
validation, the freshness checker fetches the current content at the
node's source path and compares hashes. Different hash → stale node.

When you update code that a node points at, you must rehash the node:

1. Read the current content (respecting `source.lines` if set)
2. Compute `sha256:<hex>`
3. Update `source.content_hash` and `updated_at` in the node file

Leave `content_hash: null` if you don't know — the validator will flag
it as stale and the next agent working there can rehash.

## Edge types

Edges are derived from the data, never stored as separate files:

| Edge | Source | How |
|---|---|---|
| Issue → Node | issue body | `[[node-id]]` in the Markdown |
| Issue → Issue | issue frontmatter | `blocked_by: [OTHER-1]` |
| Issue → Requirement | issue frontmatter | `implements: [REQ-001]` |
| Node → Node | node frontmatter | `related: [other-node]` (bi-directional) |
| Node → Source | node frontmatter | `source: {repo, path, lines, content_hash}` |

## Bi-directional `related`

If `node-a.related` contains `node-b`, then `node-b.related` must
contain `node-a`. The validator warns on one-sided refs and `--fix`
auto-adds the missing side. Write both sides yourself — it's clearer.

## Commands

- `keel refs list <issue-key>` — see an issue's references
- `keel refs reverse <node-id>` — see what references a node
- `keel refs check` — full scan for dangling/orphan/stale refs
- `keel node check [node-id]` — freshness check
- `keel graph --type concept` — render the full graph
